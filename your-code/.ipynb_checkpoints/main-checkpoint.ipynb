An attacker plants malware on your system that encrypts all the files, making your system useless, then offers to sell you the key you need to decrypt the files. Payment is usually in bitcoin (BTC), and the decryption key is deleted if you don’t pay within a certain period. Payments have typically been relatively small—though that’s obviously no longer true, with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/22428774/ransomeware-pipeline-colonial-darkside-gas-prices\">Colonial Pipeline</a>’s multimillion-dollar payout.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Recently, ransomware attacks have been coupled with extortion: the malware sends valuable data (for example, a database of credit card numbers) back to the attacker, who then threatens to publish the data online if you don’t comply with the request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A survey on O’Reilly’s website<sup>1</sup> showed that 6% of the respondents worked for organizations that were victims of ransomware attacks. How do you avoid joining them? We’ll have more to say about that, but the tl;dr is simple: pay attention to security basics. Strong passwords, two-factor authentication, defense in depth, staying on top of software updates, good backups, and the ability to restore from backups go a long way. Not only do they protect you from becoming a ransomware victim, but those basics can also help protect you from data theft, cryptojacking, and most other forms of cybercrime. The sad truth is that few organizations practice good security hygiene—and those that don’t end up paying the price.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But what about ransomware? Why is it such an issue, and how is it evolving? Historically, ransomware has been a relatively easy way to make money: set up operations in a country that’s not likely to investigate cybercrime, attack targets that are more likely to pay a ransom, keep the ransom small so it’s easier to pay than to restore from backup, and accept payment via some medium that’s perceived as anonymous. Like most things on the internet, ransomware’s advantage is scale: The WannaCry attack infected around 230,000 systems. If even a small percentage paid the US$300 ransom, that’s a lot of money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Early on, attacks focused on small and midsize businesses, which often have limited IT staff and no professional security specialists. But more recently, hospitals, governments, and other organizations with valuable data have been attacked. A modern hospital can’t operate without patient data, so restoring systems is literally a matter of <a href=\"https://hitconsultant.net/2021/01/05/death-by-ransomware-healthcare-cybersecurity/\">life and death</a>. Most recently, we’ve seen attacks against large enterprises, like Colonial Pipeline. And this move toward bigger targets, with more valuable data, has been accompanied by larger ransoms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Attackers have also gotten more sophisticated and <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2021-06-ransomware-dark-webs-cybercriminals-collaborate.html\">specialized</a>. They’ve set up help desks and customer service agents (much like any other company) to help customers make their payments and decrypt their data. Some criminal organizations offer “ransomware as a service,” running attacks for customers. Others develop the software or create the attacks that find victims. Initiating an attack doesn’t require any technical knowledge; it can all be contracted out, and the customer gets a nice dashboard to show the attack’s progress.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While it’s easy to believe (and probably correct) that government actors have gotten into the game, it’s important to keep in mind that attribution of an attack is very difficult—not least because of the number of actors involved. An “as a service” operator really doesn’t care who its clients are, and its clients may be (willingly) unaware of exactly what they’re buying. Plausible deniability is also a service.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>How an attack begins</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ransomware attacks frequently start with phishing. An email to a victim entices them to open an attachment or to visit a website that installs malware. So the first thing you can do to prevent ransomware attacks is to make sure everyone is aware of phishing, very skeptical of any attachments they receive, and appropriately cautious about the websites they visit. Unfortunately, teaching people how to avoid being victimized by a phish is a battle you’re not likely to win. Phishes are getting increasingly sophisticated and now do a good job of impersonating people the victim knows. <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3334617/what-is-spear-phishing-why-targeted-email-attacks-are-so-difficult-to-stop.html\">Spear phishing</a> requires extensive research, and ransomware criminals have typically tried to compromise systems in bulk. But recently, we’ve been seeing attacks against more valuable victims. Larger, more valuable targets, with correspondingly bigger payouts, will merit the investment in research.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s also possible for an attack to start when a victim visits a legitimate but compromised website. In some cases, an attack can start without any action by the victim. Some ransomware (for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack\">WannaCry</a>) can spread directly from computer to computer. One recent attack started through a <a href=\"https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/07/02/kaseya-vsa-supply-chain-ransomware-attack\">supply chain compromise</a>: attackers planted the ransomware in an enterprise security product, which was then distributed unwittingly to the product’s customers. Almost any vulnerability can be exploited to plant a ransomware payload on a victim’s device. Keeping browsers up-to-date helps to defend against compromised websites.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most ransomware attacks begin on Windows systems or on mobile phones. This isn’t to imply that macOS, Linux, and other operating systems are less vulnerable; it’s just that other attack vectors are more common. We can guess at some reasons for this. Mobile phones move between different domains, as the owner goes from a coffee shop to home to the office, and are exposed to different networks with different risk factors. Although they are often used in risky territory, they’re rarely subject to the same device management that’s applied to “company” systems—but they’re often accorded the same level of trust. Therefore, it’s relatively easy for a phone to be compromised outside the office and then bring the attacker onto the corporate network when its owner returns to work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s possible that Windows systems are common attack vectors just because there are so many of them, particularly in business environments. Many also believe that Windows users install updates less often than macOS and Linux users. Microsoft does a good job of patching vulnerabilities before they can be exploited, but that doesn’t do any good if updates aren’t installed. For example, Microsoft discovered and patched the vulnerability that WannaCry exploited well before the attacks began, but many individuals, and many companies, never installed the updates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Preparations and precautions</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The best defense against ransomware is to be prepared, starting with basic security hygiene. Frankly, this is true of any attack: get the basics right and you’ll have much less to worry about. If you’ve defended yourself against ransomware, you’ve done a lot to defend yourself against data theft, cryptojacking, and many other forms of cybercrime.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security hygiene is simple in concept but hard in practice. It starts with passwords: Users must have nontrivial passwords. And they should never give their password to someone else, whether or not “someone else” is on staff (or claims to be). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires something in addition to a password (for example, biometric authentication or a text message sent to a cell phone) is a must. Don’t just recommend 2FA; require it. Too many organizations buy and install the software but never require their staff to use it. (76% of the respondents to our survey said that their company used 2FA; 14% said they weren’t sure.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Users should be aware of phishing and be extremely skeptical of email attachments that they weren’t expecting and websites that they didn’t plan to visit. It’s always a good practice to type URLs in yourself, rather than clicking on links in email—even those in messages that appear to be from friends or associates. Users should be aware of phishing and be extremely skeptical of email attachments that they weren’t expecting and websites that they didn’t plan to visit. It’s always a good practice to type URLs in yourself, rather than clicking on links in email—even those in messages that appear to be from friends or associates.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Backups are absolutely essential. But what’s even more important is the ability to restore from a backup. The easiest solution to ransomware is to reformat the disks and restore from backup. Unfortunately, few companies have good backups or the ability to restore from a backup—one security expert guesses that it’s as low as 10%. Here are a few key points:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>You actually have to do the backups. (Many companies don’t.) Don’t rely solely on cloud storage; backup on physical drives that are disconnected when a backup isn’t in progress. (70% of our survey respondents said that their company performed backups regularly.)</li><li>You have to test the backups to ensure that you can restore the system. If you have a backup but can’t restore, you’re only pretending that you have a backup. (Only 48% of the respondents said that their company regularly practiced restoring from backups; 36% said they didn’t know.)</li><li>The backup device needs to be offline, connected only when a backup is in progress. Otherwise, it’s possible for the ransomware attack to encrypt your backup.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Don’t overlook testing your backups. Your business continuity planning should include ransomware scenarios: how do you continue doing business while systems are being restored? Chaos engineering, an approach developed at Netflix, is a good idea. Make a practice of breaking your storage capability, then restoring it from backup. Do this monthly—if possible, schedule it with the product and project management teams. Testing the ability to restore your production systems isn’t just about proving that everything works; it’s about training staff to react calmly in a crisis and resolve the outage efficiently. When something goes bad, you don’t want to be on Stack Overflow asking how to do a restore. You want that knowledge imprinted in everyone’s brains.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Keep operating systems and browsers up-to-date. Too many have become victims because of a vulnerability that was patched in a software update that they didn’t install. (79% of our survey respondents said that their company had processes for updating critical software, including browsers.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An important principle in any kind of security is “least privilege.” No person or system should be authorized to do anything it doesn’t need to do. For example, no one outside of HR should have access to the employee database. “Of course,” you say—but that includes the CEO. No one outside of sales should have access to the customer database. And so on. Least privilege works for software too. Services need access to other services—but services must authenticate to each other and should only be able to make requests appropriate to their role. Any unexpected request should be rejected and treated as a signal that the software has been compromised. And least privilege works for hardware, whether virtual or physical: finance systems and servers shouldn’t be able to access HR systems, for example. Ideally, they should be on separate networks. You should have a “defense in depth” security strategy that focuses not only on keeping “bad guys” out of your network but also on limiting where they can go once they’re inside. You want to stop an attack that originates on HR systems from finding its way to the finance systems or some other part of the company. Particularly when you’re dealing with ransomware, making it difficult for an attack to propagate from one system to another is all-important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) can be seen as an extension of least privilege. ABAC is based on defining policies about exactly who and what should be allowed to access every service: What are the criteria on which trust should be based? And how do these criteria change over time? If a device suddenly moves between networks, does that represent a risk? If a system suddenly makes a request that it has never made before, has it been compromised? At what point should access to services be denied? ABAC, done right, is difficult and requires a lot of human involvement: looking at logs, deciding what kinds of access are appropriate, and keeping policies up-to-date as the situation changes. Working from home is an example of a major change that security people will need to take into account. You might have “trusted” an employee’s laptop, but should you trust it when it’s on the same network as their children? Some of this can be automated, but the bottom line is that you can’t automate security. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally: detecting a ransomware attack isn’t difficult. If you think about it, this makes a lot of sense: encrypting all your files requires a lot of CPU and filesystem activity, and that’s a red flag. The way files change is also a giveaway. Most unencrypted files have low entropy: they have a high degree of order. (On the simplest level, you can glance at a text file and tell that it’s text. That’s because it has a certain kind of order. Other kinds of files are also ordered, though the order isn’t as apparent to a human.) Encrypted files have high entropy (i.e., they’re very disordered)—they have to be; otherwise, they’d be easy to decrypt. Computing a file’s entropy is simple and for these purposes doesn’t require looking at the entire file. Many security products for desktop and laptop systems are capable of detecting and stopping a ransomware attack. We don’t do product recommendations, but we do recommend that you research the products that are available. (<em>PC Magazine</em>’s 2021 <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-ransomware-protection\">review</a> of ransomware detection products is a good place to start.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>In the data center or the cloud</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Detecting ransomware once it has escaped into a data center, whether in the cloud or on-premises, isn’t a fundamentally different task, but commercial products aren’t there yet. Again, prevention is the best defense, and the best defense is strong on the fundamentals. Ransomware makes its way from a desktop to a data center via compromised credentials and operating systems that are unpatched and unprotected. We can’t say this too often: make sure secrets are protected, make sure identity and access management are configured correctly, make sure you have a backup strategy (and that the backups work), and make sure operating systems are patched—zero-trust is your friend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud all have services named “Identity and Access Management” (IAM); the fact that they all converged on the same name tells you something about how important it is. These are the services that configure users, roles, and privileges, and they’re the key to protecting your cloud assets. IAM doesn’t have a reputation for being easy. Nevertheless, it’s something you have to get right; misconfigured IAM is at the root of many cloud vulnerabilities. One <a href=\"https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/2020/10/cloud-iam-misconfiguration-risks/\">report</a> claims that well over 50% of the organizations using Google Cloud were running workloads with administrator privileges. While that report singles out Google, we believe that the same is true at other cloud providers. All of these workloads are at risk; administrator privileges should only be used for essential management tasks. Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and the other providers give you the tools you need to secure your workloads, but they can’t force you to use them correctly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s worth asking your cloud vendor some hard questions. Specifically, what kind of support can your vendor give you if you are a victim of a security breach? What can your vendor do if you lose control of your applications because IAM has been misconfigured? What can your vendor do to restore your data if you succumb to ransomware? Don’t assume that everything in the cloud is “backed up” just because it’s in the cloud. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/backup/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc\">AWS</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-overview\">Azure</a> offer backup services; <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backing-up\">Google Cloud</a> offers backup services for SQL databases but doesn’t appear to offer anything comprehensive. Whatever your solution, don’t just assume it works. Make sure that your backups can’t be accessed via the normal paths for accessing your services—that’s the cloud version of “leave your physical backup drives disconnected when not in use.” You don’t want an attacker to find your cloud backups and encrypt them too. And finally, test your backups and practice restoring your data. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Any frameworks your IT group has in place for observability will be a big help: Abnormal file activity is always suspicious. Databases that suddenly change in unexpected ways are suspicious. So are services (whether “micro” or “macroscopic”) that suddenly start to fail. If you have built observability into your systems, you’re at least partway there.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How confident are you that you can defend against a ransomware attack? In our survey, 60% of the respondents said that they were confident; another 28% said “maybe,” and 12% said “no.” We’d give our respondents good, but not great, marks on readiness (2FA, software updates, and backups). And we’d caution that confidence is good but overconfidence can be fatal. Make sure that your defenses are in place and that those defenses work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>If you become a victim</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What do you do? Many organizations just pay. (<a href=\"https://ransomwhe.re/\">Ransomwhe.re</a> tracks total payments to ransomware sites, currently estimated at $92,120,383.83.) The FBI says that you shouldn’t pay, but if you don’t have the ability to restore your systems from backups, you might not have an alternative. Although the FBI was able to recover the ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline, I don’t think there’s any case in which they’ve been able to recover decryption keys.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether paying the ransom is a good option depends on how much you trust the cybercriminals responsible for the attack. The common wisdom is that ransomware attackers are trustworthy, that they’ll give you the key you need to decrypt your data and even help you use it correctly. If the word gets out that they can’t be trusted to restore your systems, they’ll find fewer victims willing to pay up. However, at least one security vendor says that 40% of ransomware victims who pay <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en-us/articles/what-is-ransomware/\">never get their files restored</a>. That’s a very big “however,” and a very big risk—especially as ransomware demands skyrocket. Criminals are, after all, criminals. It’s all the more reason to have good backups.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s another reason not to pay that may be more important. Ransomware is a big business, and like any business, it will continue to exist as long as it’s profitable. Paying your attackers might be an easy solution short-term, but you’re just setting up the next victim. We need to protect each other, and the best way to do that is to make ransomware less profitable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another problem that victims face is extortion. If the attackers steal your data in addition to encrypting it, they can demand money not to publish your confidential data online—which may leave you with substantial penalties for exposing private data under laws such as GDPR and CCPA. This secondary attack is becoming increasingly common.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether or not they pay, ransomware victims frequently face revictimization because they never fix the vulnerability that allowed the ransomware in the first place. So they pay the ransom, and a few months later, they’re attacked again, using the same vulnerability. The attack may come from the same people or it may come from someone else. Like any other business, an attacker wants to maximize its profits, and that might mean selling the information they used to compromise your systems to other ransomware outfits. If you become a victim, take that as a very serious warning. Don’t think that the story is over when you’ve restored your systems. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Here’s the bottom line, whether or not you pay. If you become a victim of ransomware, figure out how the ransomware got in and plug those holes. We began this article by talking about basic security practices. Keep your software up-to-date. Use two-factor authentication. Implement defense in depth wherever possible. Design zero-trust into your applications. And above all, get serious about backups and practice restoring from backup regularly. You don’t want to become a victim again. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Thanks to John Viega, Dean Bushmiller, Ronald Eddings, and Matthew Kirk for their help.

       "     'value': '<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computing/\">first article</a> of this series, we discussed communal computing devices and the problems they create–or, more precisely, the problems that arise because we don’t really understand what “communal” means. Communal devices are intended to be used by groups of people in homes and offices. Examples include popular home assistants and smart displays like the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple HomePod, and many others.&nbsp; If we don’t create these devices with communities of people in mind, we will continue to build the wrong ones.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ever since the concept of a “user” was invented (which was probably later than you think), we’ve assumed that devices are “owned” by a single user. Someone buys the device and sets up the account; it’s their device, their account.&nbsp; When we’re building shared devices with a user model, that model quickly runs into limitations. What happens when you want your home assistant to play music for a dinner party, but your preferences have been skewed by your children’s listening habits? We, as users, have certain expectations for what a device should do. But we, as technologists, have typically ignored our own expectations when designing and building those devices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This expectation isn’t a new one either. The telephone in the kitchen was for everyone’s use. After the release of the iPad in 2010 <a href=\"https://furbo.org/2010/04/29/communal-computing/\">Craig Hockenberry discussed the great value of communal computing but also the concerns</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“When you pass it around, you’re giving everyone who touches it the opportunity to mess with your private life, whether intentionally or not. That makes me uneasy.”</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Communal computing requires a new mindset that takes into account users’ expectations. If the devices aren’t designed with those expectations in mind, they’re destined for the landfill. Users will eventually experience “weirdness” and “annoyance” that grows to distrust of the device itself. As technologists, we often call these weirdnesses “edge cases.” That’s precisely where we’re wrong: they’re not edge cases, but they’re at the core of how people want to use these devices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the first article, we listed five core questions we should ask about communal devices:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Identity: Do we know all of the people who are using the device?</li><li>Privacy: Are we exposing (or hiding) the right content for all of the people with access?</li><li>Security: Are we allowing all of the people using the device to do or see what they should and are we protecting the content from people that shouldn’t?</li><li>Experience: What is the contextually appropriate display or next action?</li><li>Ownership: Who owns all of the data and services attached to the device that multiple people are using?</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this article, we’ll take a deeper look at these questions, to see how the problems manifest and how to understand them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Identity</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of the problems we’ve listed start with the idea that there is one registered and known person who should use the device. That model doesn’t fit reality: the identity of a communal device isn’t a single person, but everyone who can interact with it. This could be anyone able to tap the screen, make a voice command, use a remote, or simply be sensed by it. To understand this communal model and the problems it poses, start with the person who buys and sets up the device. It is associated with that individual’s account, like a personal Amazon account with its order history and shopping list. Then it gets difficult. Who doesn&#8217;t, can’t, or shouldn’t have full access to an Amazon account? Do you want everyone who comes into your house to be able to add something to your shopping list?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you think about the spectrum of people who could be in your house, they range from people whom you trust, to people who you don’t really trust but who should be there, to those who you&nbsp; shouldn’t trust at all.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13877\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/trust-1048x387.png\" /><figcaption><br />There is a spectrum of trust for people who have access to communal devices</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In addition to individuals, we need to consider the groups that each person could be part of. These group memberships are called “pseudo-identities”; they are facets of a person’s full identity. They are usually defined by how the person associated themself with a group of other people. My life at work, home, a high school friends group, and as a sports fan show different parts of my identity. When I’m with other people who share the same pseudo-identity, we can share information. When there are people from one group in front of a device I may avoid showing content that is associated with another group (or another personal pseudo-identity). This can sound abstract, but it isn’t; if you’re with friends in a sports bar, you probably want notifications about the teams you follow. You probably don’t want news about work, unless it’s an emergency.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are important reasons why we show a particular facet of our identity in a particular context. When designing an experience, you need to consider the identity context and where the experience will take place. Most recently this has come up with work from home. Many people talk about ‘<a href=\"https://mike-robbins.com/tedxberkeley/\">bringing your whole self to work</a>,’ but don&#8217;t realize that “your whole self” isn’t always appropriate. Remote work changes when and where I should interact with work. For a smart screen in my kitchen, it is appropriate to have content that is related to my home and family. Is it appropriate to have all of my work notifications and meetings there? Could it be a problem for children to have the ability to join my work calls? What does my IT group require as far as security of work devices versus personal home devices?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With these devices we may need to switch to a different pseudo-identity to get something done. I may need to be reminded of a work meeting. When I get a notification from a close friend, I need to decide whether it is appropriate to respond based on the other people around me.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The pandemic has broken down the barriers between home and work. The natural context switch from being at work and worrying about work things and then going home to worry about home things is no longer the case. People need to make a conscious effort to “turn off work” and to change the context. Just because it is the middle of the workday doesn’t always mean I want to be bothered by work. I may want to change contexts to take a break. Such context shifts add nuance to the way the current pseudo-identity should be considered, and to the overarching context you need to detect.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Next, we need to consider identities as groups that I belong to. I’m part of my family, and my family would potentially want to talk with other families. I live in a house that is on my street alongside other neighbors. I’m part of an organization that I identify as my work. These are all pseudo-identities we should consider, based on where the device is placed and in relation to other equally important identities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The crux of the problem with communal devices is the multiple identities that are or may be using the device. This requires greater understanding of who, where, and why people are using the device. We need to consider the types of groups that are part of the home and office.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Privacy </h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we consider the identities of all people with access to the device, and the identity of the place the device is to be part of, we start to consider what privacy expectations people may have given the context in which the device is used.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Privacy is hard to understand. The framework I’ve found most helpful is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity\">Contextual Integrity</a> which was introduced by Helen Nissenbaum in the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Privacy-Context-Technology-Policy-Integrity/dp/0804752370\">Privacy in Context</a>. Contextual Integrity describes four key aspects of privacy:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Privacy is provided by appropriate flows of information.</li><li>Appropriate information flows are those that conform to contextual information norms.</li><li>Contextual informational norms refer to five independent parameters: data subject, sender, recipient, information type, and transmission principle.</li><li>Conceptions of privacy are based on ethical concerns that evolve over time.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What is most important about Contextual Integrity is that privacy is not about hiding information away from the public but giving people a way to control the flow of their own information. The context in which information is shared determines what is appropriate.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This flow either feels appropriate, or not, based on key characteristics of the information (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_Integrity#Contextual_Integrity%E2%80%99s_Parameters\">from Wikipedia</a>):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>The data subject: Who or what is this about?</li><li>The sender of the data: Who is sending it?</li><li>The recipient of the data: Who will eventually see or get the data?</li><li>The information type: What type of information is this (e.g. a photo, text)?</li><li>The transmission principle: In what set of norms is this being shared (e.g. school, medical, personal communication)?</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We rarely acknowledge how a subtle change in one of these parameters could be a violation of privacy. It may be completely acceptable for my friend to have a weird photo of me, but once it gets posted on a company intranet site it violates how I want information (a photo) to flow. The recipient of the data has changed to something I no longer find acceptable. But I might not care whether a complete stranger (like a burglar) sees the photo, as long as it never gets back to someone I know.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For communal use cases, the sender or receiver of information is often a group. There may be&nbsp; multiple people in the room during a video call, not just the person you are calling. People can walk in and out. I might be happy with some people in my home seeing a particular photo, but find it embarrassing if it is shown to guests at a dinner party.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We must also consider what happens when other people’s content is shown to those who shouldn’t see it. This content could be photos or notifications from people outside the communal space that could be seen by anyone in front of the device. Smartphones can hide message contents when you aren’t near your phone for this exact reason.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The services themselves can expand the ‘receivers’ of information in ways that create uncomfortable situations. In Privacy in Context, Nissenbaum talks about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Street_View_privacy_concerns\">the privacy implications of Google Street View when it places photos of people’s houses</a> on Google Maps. When a house was only visible to people who walked down the street that was one thing, but when anyone in the world can access a picture of a house, that changes the parameters in a way that causes concern. Most recently, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262646/ibm-didnt-inform-people-when-it-used-their-flickr-photos-for-facial-recognition-training\">IBM used Flickr photos that were shared under a Creative Commons license to train facial recognition algorithms</a>. While this didn’t require any change to terms of the service it was a surprise to people and may be in violation of the Creative Commons license. In the end, IBM took the dataset down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Privacy considerations for communal devices should focus on who is gaining access to information and whether it is appropriate based on people’s expectations. Without using a framework like contextual inquiry we will be stuck talking about generalized rules for data sharing, and there will always be edge cases that violate someone’s privacy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<h5>A note about children</h5>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">Children make identity and privacy especially tricky. <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/242074/percentages-of-us-family-households-with-children-by-type/#statisticContainer\">About 40% of all households</a> have a child. Children shouldn’t be an afterthought. If you aren’t compliant with local laws you can get in a lot of trouble. In 2019, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/youtube-fined-170-million-for-violations-of-childrens-privacy/\">YouTube had to settle with the FTC</a> for a $170 million fine for selling ads targeting children. It gets complicated because the ‘age of consent’ depends on the region as well: <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule\">COPPA in the US is for people under 13 years old</a>, <a href=\"https://www.clarip.com/data-privacy/ccpa-kids-consent/\">CCPA in California is for people under 16</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.privo.com/blog/gdpr-age-of-digital-consent\">GDPR overall is under 16 years old but each member state can set its own</a>. The moment you acknowledge children are using your platforms, you need to accommodate them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">For communal devices, there are many use cases for children. Once they realize they can play whatever music they want (including tracks of fart sounds) on a shared device they will do it. Children focus on the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812153637.htm\">exploration over the task</a> and will end up discovering way more about the device than parents might. Adjusting your practices after building a device is a recipe for failure. You will find that the paradigms you choose for other parties won’t align with the expectations for children, and modifying your software to accommodate children is difficult or impossible. It’s important to account for children from the beginning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Security </h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To get to a home assistant, you usually need to pass through a home’s outer door. There is usually a physical limitation by way of a lock. There may be alarm systems. Finally, there are social norms: you don’t just walk into someone else’s house without knocking or being invited.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Once you are past all of these locks, alarms, and norms, anyone can access the communal device. Few things within a home are restricted–possibly a safe with important documents. When a communal device requires authentication, it is usually subverted in some way for convenience: for example, a password might be taped to it, or a password may never have been set.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The concept of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Trust-Networks-Building-Untrusted/dp/1491962194\">Zero Trust Networks</a> speaks to this problem. It comes down to a key question: is the risk associated with an action greater than the trust we have that the person performing the action is who they say they are?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/oIE9EerVy1LX6be50IEGWVshKMNJV47fbOCgQ2n7kHTkmZgEISlRx5t6dmzjDxldR1XlDpaDMFiMFp7rnKnTV3T1RyNXBerEUx9QOy7VsKqfSqbRcIssbDbOfl9yfhwJpmrb3cvv\" /><figcaption><br />Source: <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/\">https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/</a> </figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Passwords, passcodes, or mobile device authentication become nuisances; these supposed secrets are frequently shared between everyone who has access to the device. Passwords might be written down for people who can’t remember them, making them visible to less trusted people visiting your household. Have we not learned anything since the movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UqEg1cFqig\">War Games</a>?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we consider the risk associated with an action, we need to understand its privacy implications. Would the action expose someone’s information without their knowledge? Would it allow a person to pretend to be someone else? Could another party tell easily the device was being used by an imposter?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There is a tradeoff between the trust and risk. The device needs to calculate whether we know who the person is and whether the person wants the information to be shown. That needs to be weighed against the potential risk or harm if an inappropriate person is in front of the device.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HS9D_BfERJDalfgZqmP54N9LcJNKB9jsfciGJGjHwwY01hMgMDs6p4Hrivp-nUmtMbLuoiTX1MxGwBKbLRfqvpCiHeou88dgaV7MRpv1cU852iH75aFunOMRY7amt1-6nEbGJxNS\" /><figcaption><br />Having someone in your home accidentally share embarrassing photos could have social implications.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A few examples of this tradeoff:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Risk and trust calculation</strong></td><td><strong>Possible issues</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Showing a photo when the device detects someone in the room</td><td>Photo content sensitivity, who is in the room&nbsp;</td><td>Showing an inappropriate photo to a complete stranger</td></tr><tr><td>Starting a video call</td><td>Person’s account being used for the call, the actual person starting the call</td><td>When the other side picks up it may not be who they thought it would be</td></tr><tr><td>Playing a personal song playlist</td><td>Personal recommendations being impacted</td><td>Incorrect future recommendations</td></tr><tr><td>Automatically ordering something based on a voice command</td><td>Convenience of ordering, approval of the shopping account’s owner</td><td>Shipping an item that shouldn’t have been ordered</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This gets even trickier when people no longer in the home can access the devices remotely. There have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/technology/smart-home-devices-domestic-abuse.html\">cases of harassment, intimidation, and domestic abuse</a> by people whose access should have been revoked: for example, an ex-partner turning off the heating system. When should someone be able to access communal devices remotely? When should their access be controllable from the devices themselves? How should people be reminded to update their access control lists? How does basic security maintenance happen inside a communal space? </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>See how much work this takes in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bryanmcaninch/status/1396099891802353671\">recent account of pro bono security work</a> for a harassed mother and her son. Or how a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_DanielSinclair/status/1405686762563719174\">YouTuber was blackmailed, surveilled, and harassed by her smart home</a>. <a href=\"https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1976/en_US/device-and-data-access-when-personal-safety-is-at-risk.pdf\">Apple even has a manual</a> for this type of situation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At home, where there’s no corporate IT group to create policies and automation to keep things secure, it’s next to impossible to manage all of these security issues. Even some corporations have trouble with it. We need to figure out how users will maintain and configure a communal device over time. Configuration for devices in the home and office can be wrought with lots of different types of needs over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, what happens when someone leaves the home and is no longer part of it? We will need to remove their access and may even find it necessary to block them from certain services. This is highlighted with the cases of harassment of people through spouses that still control the communal devices. Ongoing maintenance of a particular device could also be triggered by a change in needs by the community. A home device may be used to just play music or check the weather at first. But when a new baby comes home, being able to do video calling with close relatives may become a higher priority.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>End users are usually very bad at changing configuration after it is set. They may not even know that they can configure something in the first place. This is why people have made a business out of setting up home stereo and video systems. People just don’t understand the technologies they are putting in their houses. Does that mean we need some type of handy-person that does home device setup and management? When more complicated routines are required to meet the needs, how does someone allow for changes without writing code, if they are allowed to?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Communal devices need new paradigms of security that go beyond the standard login. The world inside a home is protected by a barrier like a locked door; the capabilities of communal devices should respect that. This means both removing friction in some cases and increasing it in others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<h5>A note about biometrics</h5>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qbw387_ORSOiu1Mgg3qhPgTkqbswCa4_ErEyVBjfNVjyUK10Qsp1OoxXif2W4g_p11GP9kwIEW_19G1nV0p8I_zggBTciyFLHaB82PBkuN3PMWSJLNaGRCtUGB77CmAN7IeFbYVb\" /><figcaption><br />&nbsp;“Turn your face” to enroll in Google Face Match and personalize your devices.<br /><em>(Source: Google Face Match video, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ODy_xJHW6CI?t=26\">https://youtu.be/ODy_xJHW6CI?t=26</a>) </em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">Biometric authentication for voice and face recognition can help us get a better understanding of who is using a device. Examples of biometric authentication include <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108\">FaceID</a> for the iPhone and voice profiles for Amazon Alexa. There is a push for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393873/ftc-ai-machine-learning-race-gender-bias-legal-violation\">regulation of facial recognition technologies</a>, but opt-in for authentication purposes tends to be carved out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">However, biometrics aren’t without problems. In addition to issues with <a href=\"http://gendershades.org/overview.html\">skin tone, gender bias</a>, and <a href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2020/03/23/automated-speech-recognition-less-accurate-blacks/\">local accents</a>, biometrics assumes that everyone is willing to have a biometric profile on the device–and that they would be legally allowed to (for example, children may not be allowed to consent to a biometric profile). It also assumes this technology is secure. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9320885?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en\">Google FaceMatch makes it very clear it is only a technology for personalization,</a> rather than authentication. I can only guess they have legalese to avoid liability when an unauthorized person spoofs someone’s face, say by taking a photo off the wall and showing it to the device.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">What do we mean by “personalization?” When you walk into a room and FaceMatch identifies your face, the Google Home Hub dings, shows your face icon, then shows your calendar (if it is connected), and a feed of personalized cards. Apple’s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208108\">FaceID uses many levels of presentation attack detection</a> (also known as “anti-spoofing”): it verifies your eyes are open and you are looking at the screen, and it uses a depth sensor to make sure it isn’t “seeing” a photo. The phone can then show hidden notification content or open the phone to the home screen. This measurement of trust and risk is benefited by understanding who could be in front of the device. We can’t forget that the machine learning that is doing biometrics is not a deterministic calculation; there is always some degree of uncertainty.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">Social and information norms define what we consider acceptable, who we trust, and how much. As trust goes up, we can take more risks in the way we handle information. However, it’s difficult to connect trust with risk without understanding people’s expectations. I have access to my <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/password-security-sharing\">partner’s iPhone and know the passcode</a>. It would be a violation of a norm if I walked over and unlocked it without being asked, and doing so will lead to reduced trust between us. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">As we can see, biometrics does offer some benefits but won’t be the panacea for the unique uses of communal devices. Biometrics will allow those willing to opt-in to the collection of their biometric profile to gain personalized access with low friction, but it will never be useable for everyone with physical access. </p>\\n</div></div>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Experiences</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>People use a communal device for short experiences (checking the weather), ambient experiences (listening to music or glancing at a photo), and joint experiences (multiple people watching a movie). The device needs to be aware of norms within the space and between the multiple people in the space. Social norms are rules by which people decide how to act in a particular context or space. In the home, there are norms about what people should and should not do. If you are a guest, you try to see if people take their shoes off at the door; you don’t rearrange things on a bookshelf; and so on.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most software is built to work for as many people as possible; this is called generalization. Norms stand in the way of generalization. Today’s technology isn’t good enough to adapt to every possible situation. One strategy is to simplify the software’s functionality and let the humans enforce norms. For example, when multiple people talk to an Echo at the same time, Alexa will either not understand or it will take action on the last command. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21452313/alexa-voice-assistant-ai-upgrade-amazon-echo-smart-speaker-multiple-people-tone-questions\">Multi-turn conversations between multiple people</a> are still in their infancy. This is fine when there are understood norms–for example, between my partner and I. But it doesn’t work so well when you and a child are both trying to shout commands.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DqO-tlVqweGB2Qn0dTCipZ9XZ-GlJKnel9bxMdOWKhqKjVYqftcKw6GNketKIQvVNjAAwsAVnH52CAd0K9KvF-idqGZtcbuTVKzPQM5uZiqcvPc9sQ0oBLzwsPm5NBdltxgvuJ0h\" /><figcaption><br />Shared experiences can be challenging like a parent and child yelling at an Amazon Echo to play what they want.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Norms are interesting because they tend to be learned and negotiated over time, but are invisible. Experiences that are built for communal use need to be aware of these invisible norms through cues that can be detected from peoples’ actions and words. This gets especially tricky because a conversation between two people could include information subject to different expectations (in a Contextual Integrity sense) about how that information is used. With enough data, models can be created to “read between the lines” in both helpful and dangerous ways.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Video games already cater to multiple people’s experiences. With the Nintendo Switch or any other gaming system, several people can play together in a joint experience. However, the rules governing these experiences are never applied to, say, Netflix. The assumption is always that one person holds the remote. How might these experiences be improved if software could accept input from multiple sources (remote controls, voice, etc.) to build a selection of movies that is appropriate for everyone watching?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Communal experience problems highlight inequalities in households. With <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/17/upshot/women-workforce-employment-covid.html\">women doing more household coordination</a> than ever, there is a need to rebalance the tasks for households. Most of the time these coordination tasks are relegated to personal devices, generally the wife’s mobile phone, when they involve the entire family (though there is a <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/digital/bridging-the-digital-gender-divide.pdf\">digital divide outside the US</a>). Without moving these experiences into a place that everyone can participate in, we will continue these inequalities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So far, technology has been great at intermediating people for coordination through systems like text messaging, social networks, and collaborative documents. We don’t build interaction paradigms that allow for multiple people to engage at the same time in their communal spaces. To do this we need to address that the norms that dictate what is appropriate behavior are invisible and pervasive in the spaces these technologies are deployed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Ownership</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Many of these devices are not really owned by the people who buy them. As part of the current trend towards subscription-based business models, the device won’t function if you don’t subscribe to a service. Those services have license agreements that specify what you can and cannot do (which you can read if you have a <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/terms-of-service-visualizing-the-length-of-internet-agreements/\">few hours to spare</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/12/opinion/facebook-google-privacy-policies.html\">can understand them</a>).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, this has been an issue for fans of Amazon’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22381356/blink-homebridge-crackdown-amazon-subscriptions\">Blink camera</a>. The home automation industry is fragmented: there are many vendors, each with its own application to control their particular devices. But most people don’t want to use different apps to control their lighting, their television, their security cameras, and their locks. Therefore, people have started to build controllers that span the different ecosystems. Doing so has caused Blink users to get their accounts suspended.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What’s even worse is that these license agreements can change whenever the company wants. Licenses are frequently modified with nothing more than a notification, after which something that was previously acceptable is now forbidden. In 2020, <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/smart-home/wink-tells-users-pay-up-or-we-will-disable-smart-home-hub/\">Wink suddenly applied</a> a monthly service charge; if you didn’t pay, the device would stop working. Also in 2020, Sonos caused a stir by saying they were going to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166777/sonos-ending-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-sustainability\">“recycle” (disable) old devices.</a> They eventually changed their policy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The issue isn’t just what you can do with your devices; it’s also what happens to the data they create. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/doorbell-camera-firm-ring-has-partnered-with-police-forces-extending-surveillance-reach/\">Amazon’s Ring partnership</a> with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/18/amazon-ring-largest-civilian-surveillance-network-us\">one in ten US police departments</a> troubles many privacy groups because it creates a vast surveillance program. What if you don’t want to be a part of the police state? Make sure you check the right box and read your terms of service. If you’re designing a device, you need to require users to opt in to data sharing (especially as regions adapt GDPR and CCPA-like regulation).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While techniques like <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html\">federated learning</a> are on the horizon, to avoid latency issues and mass data collection, it remains to be seen whether those techniques are satisfactory for companies that collect data. Is there a benefit to both organizations and their customers to limit or obfuscate the transmission of data away from the device?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ownership is particularly tricky for communal devices. This is a collision between the expectations of consumers who put something in their home; those expectations run directly against the way rent-to-use services are pitched. Until we acknowledge that hardware put in a home is different from a cloud service, we will never get it right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Lots of problems, now what?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now that we have dived into the various problems that rear their head with communal devices, what do we do about it? In the next article we discuss a way to consider the map of the communal space. This helps build a better understanding of how the communal device fits in the context of the space and services that exist already.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We will also provide a list of dos and don’ts for leaders, developers, and designers to consider when building a communal device.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/f9SUI9x-1V8\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.metaobject.com/2021/06/glue-dark-matter-of-software.html\">Glue: the Dark Matter of Software</a>, Marcel Weiher asks why there&#8217;s so much code. Why is Microsoft Office 400 million lines of code? Why are we always running into the truth of Alan Kay&#8217;s statement that &#8220;Software seems &#8216;large&#8217; and &#8216;complicated&#8217; for what it does&#8221;?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Weiher makes an interesting claim: the reason we have so much code is Glue Code, the code that connects everything together. It&#8217;s &#8220;invisible and massive&#8221;; it&#8217;s &#8220;deemed not important&#8221;; and, perhaps most important, it&#8217;s &#8220;quadratic&#8221;: the glue code is proportional to the square of the number of things you need to glue. That feels right; and in the past few years, we&#8217;ve become increasingly aware of the skyrocketing number of dependencies in any software project significantly more complex than &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; We can all add our own examples: the classic article <a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf\">Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems</a> shows a block diagram of a system in which machine learning is a tiny block in the middle, surrounded by all sorts of infrastructure: data pipelines, resource management, configuration, etc. Object Relational Management (ORM) frameworks are a kind of glue between application software and databases. Web frameworks facilitate gluing together components of various types, along with gluing that front end to some kind of back end. The list goes on.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Weiher makes another important point: the simplest abstraction for glue is the Unix pipe (|), although he points out that pipes are not the only solution. Anyone who has used Unix or a variant (and certainly anyone who has read–or in my case, written–chunks of <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/unix-power-tools/0596003307/\">Unix Power Tools</a>) realizes how powerful the pipe is. A standard way to connect tools that are designed to do one thing well: that&#8217;s important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But there&#8217;s another side to this problem, and one that we often sweep under the rug. A pipe has two ends: something that&#8217;s sending data, and something that&#8217;s receiving it. The sender needs to send data in a format that the receiver understands, or (more likely) the receiver needs to be able to parse and interpret the sender&#8217;s data in a way that it understands. You can pipe all the log data you want into an awk script (or perl, or python), but that script is still going to have to parse that data to make it interpretable. That&#8217;s really what those millions of lines of glue code do: either format data so the receiver can understand it or parse incoming data into a usable form. (This task falls more often on the receiver than the sender, largely because the sender often doesn&#8217;t—and shouldn&#8217;t—know anything about the receiver.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From this standpoint, the real problem with glue isn&#8217;t moving data, though the Unix pipe is a great abstraction; it&#8217;s data integration. In a discussion about blockchains and medical records, Jim Stogdill once said &#8220;the real problem has nothing to do with blockchains. The real problem is data integration.&#8221; You can put all the data you want on a blockchain, or in a data warehouse, or in a subsurface data ocean the size of one of Jupiter&#8217;s moons, and you won&#8217;t solve the problem that application A generates data in a form that application B can&#8217;t use. If you know anything about medical records (and I know very little), you know that&#8217;s the heart of the problem. One major vendor has products that aren&#8217;t even compatible with each other, let alone competitors&#8217; systems. Not only are data formats incompatible, the meanings of fields in the data are often different in subtle ways. Chasing down those differences can easily run to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of lines of code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Pipes are great for moving data from one place to another. But there&#8217;s no equivalent standard for data integration. XML might play a role, but it only solves the easy part of the problem: standardizing parsing has some value, but the ease of parsing XML was always oversold, and the real problems stem more from schemas than data formats. (And please don&#8217;t play the &#8220;XML is human-readable and -writable&#8221; game.) JSON strikes me as XML for &#8220;pickling&#8221; JavaScript objects, replacing angle brackets with curly braces: a good idea that has gotten a lot of cross-language support, but like XML neglects the tough part of the problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is data integration a problem that can be solved? In networking, we have standards for what data means and how to send it. All those TCP/IP packet headers that have been in use for almost 40 years (the first deployment of IPv4 was in 1982) have kept data flowing between systems built by different vendors. The fields in the header have been defined precisely, and new protocols have been built successfully at every layer of the network stack.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But this kind of standardization doesn&#8217;t solve the N squared problem. In a network stack, TCP talks to TCP; HTTPS talks to HTTPS. (Arguably, it keeps the N squared problem from being an N cubed problem.) The network stack designs the N squared problem out of existence, at least as far as the network itself is concerned, but that doesn’t help at the application layer. When we&#8217;re talking applications, a medical app needs to understand medical records, financial records, regulatory constraints, insurance records, reporting systems, and probably dozens more. Nor does standardization really solve the problem of new services. IPv4 desperately needs to be replaced (and IPv6 has been around since 1995), but IPv6 has been &#8220;5 years in the future&#8221; for two decades now. Hack on top of hack has kept IPv4 workable; but will layer and layer of hack work if we&#8217;re extending medical or financial applications?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Glue code expands as the square of the number of things that are glued. The need to glue different systems together is at the core of the problems facing software development; as systems become more all-encompassing, the need to integrate with different systems increases. The glue–which includes code written for data integration–becomes its own kind of technical debt, adding to the maintenance burden. It’s rarely (if ever) refactored or just plain removed because you always need to “maintain compatibility” with some old system.&nbsp; (Remember IE6?)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is there a solution? In the future, we’ll probably need to integrate more services.&nbsp; The glue code will be more complex, since it will probably need to live in some “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/zero-trust-networks/9781491962183/\">zero trust</a>” framework (another issue, but an important one).&nbsp; Still, knowing that you’re writing glue code, keeping track of where it is, and being proactive about removing it when it’s needed will keep the problem manageable. Designing interfaces carefully and observing standards will minimize the need for glue. In the final analysis, is glue code really a problem? Programming is ultimately about gluing things together, whether they’re microservices or programming libraries. Glue isn’t some kind of computational waste; it’s what holds our systems together.&nbsp; Glue development is software development.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/pXOzhjCg9aQ\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

There are serious challenges with such software and models, including the data they&#8217;re trained on, how they&#8217;re developed, how they&#8217;re deployed, and their impact on stakeholders. These challenges commonly result in both algorithmic bias and lack of model interpretability and explainability.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s another critical issue, which is in some ways upstream to the challenges of bias and explainability: while we seem to be living in the future with the creation of machine learning and deep learning models, we are still living in the Dark Ages with respect to the curation and labeling of our training data: <em>the vast majority of labeling is still done by hand</em>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are significant issues with hand labeling data:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>It introduces bias, and hand labels are neither interpretable nor explainable.</li><li>There are prohibitive costs to hand labeling datasets (both financial costs and the time of subject matter experts).</li><li>There is no such thing as gold labels: even the most well-known hand labeled datasets have label error rates of at least 5% (<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/01/1021619/ai-data-errors-warp-machine-learning-progress/\">ImageNet has a label error rate of 5.8%</a>!).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are living through an era in which we get to decide how human and machine intelligence interact to build intelligent software to tackle many of the world&#8217;s toughest challenges. Labeling data is a fundamental part of human-mediated machine intelligence, and hand labeling is not only the most naive approach but also one of the most expensive (in many senses) and most dangerous ways of bringing humans in the loop. Moreover, it&#8217;s just not necessary as many alternatives are seeing increasing adoption. These include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Semi-supervised learning</li><li>Weak supervision</li><li>Transfer learning</li><li>Active learning</li><li>Synthetic data generation</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These techniques are part of a broader movement known as<a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/machine-teaching/\"> Machine Teaching</a>, a core tenet of which is getting both humans and machines each doing what they do best. We need to use expertise efficiently: the financial cost and time taken for experts to hand-label every data point can break projects, such as diagnostic imaging involving life-threatening conditions and security and defense-related satellite imagery analysis. Hand labeling in the age of these other technologies is akin to scribes hand-copying books post-Gutenberg.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There is also a burgeoning landscape of companies building products around these technologies, such as<a href=\"https://www.watchful.io/\"> Watchful</a> (weak supervision and active learning; disclaimer: one of the authors is CEO of Watchful),<a href=\"https://snorkel.ai/\"> Snorkel</a> (weak supervision),<a href=\"https://prodi.gy/\"> Prodigy</a> (active learning),<a href=\"https://paralleldomain.com/\"> Parallel Domain</a> (synthetic data), and<a href=\"https://aireverie.com/\"> AI Reverie</a> (synthetic data).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Hand Labels and Algorithmic Bias</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As<a href=\"https://twitter.com/rajiinio/status/1375957288276611075\"> Deb Raji</a>, a Fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, has pointed out, algorithmic bias &#8220;can start anywhere in the system—pre-processing, post-processing, with task design, with modeling choices, etc.,&#8221; and the labeling of data is a crucial point at which bias can creep in.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13826\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Adapted-from-Cornell-University-paper-A-Framework-for-Understanding-Sources-of-Harm-throughout-the-Machine-Learning-Life-Cycle-by-Harini-Suresh-and-John-V.-Guttag-1048x697.png\" width=\"736\" /><figcaption><br />Figure 1: Bias can start anywhere in the system. Image adapted from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10002%C2%A0\">A Framework for Understanding Sources of Harm throughout the Machine Learning Life Cycle</a> by Harini Suresh and John Guttag.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>High-profile cases of bias in training data resulting in harmful models include an<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G\"> Amazon recruiting tool</a> that “penalized resumes that included the word &#8216;women’s,&#8217; as in &#8216;women’s chess club captain.&#8217;” Don&#8217;t take our word for it. Play the educational game<a href=\"https://www.survivalofthebestfit.com/\"> Survival of the Best Fit</a> where you&#8217;re a CEO who uses a machine learning model to scale their hiring decisions and see how the model replicates the bias inherent in the training data. This point is key: as humans, we possess all types of biases, some harmful, others not so. When we feed hand labeled data to a machine learning model, it will detect those patterns and replicate them at scale. This is why<a href=\"https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/rim3pvdw/release/6\"> David Donoho astutely observed</a> that perhaps we should call ML models <em>recycled intelligence</em> rather than <em>artificial intelligence</em>. Of course, given the amount of bias in hand labeled data, it may be more apt to refer to it as <em>recycled stupidity</em> (hat tip to<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_stupidity\"> <em>artificial stupidity</em></a>).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The only way to interrogate the reasons for underlying bias arising from hand labels is to ask the labelers themselves their rationales for the labels in question, which is impractical, if not impossible, in the majority of cases: there are rarely records of who did the labeling, it is often outsourced via at-scale global APIs, such as Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk and, when labels are created in-house, previous labelers are often no longer part of the organization.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Uninterpretable, Unexplainable</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This leads to another key point: the lack of both interpretability and explainability in models built on hand labeled data. These are related concepts, and broadly speaking, interpretability is about correlation, whereas explainability is about causation. The former involves thinking about which features are correlated with the output variable, while the latter is concerned with why certain features lead to particular labels and predictions. We want models that give us results we can explain and some notion of how or why they work. For example, in the<a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing\"> ProPublica exposé of COMPAS recidivism risk model</a>, which made more false predictions that Black people would re-offend than it did for white people, it is essential to understand why the model is making the predictions it does. Lack of explainability and transparency were key ingredients of all the deployed-at-scale algorithms identified by Cathy O&#8217;Neil in<a href=\"https://weaponsofmathdestructionbook.com/\"> <em>Weapons of Math Destruction</em></a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It may be counterintuitive that getting machines more in-the-loop for labeling can result in more explainable models but consider several examples:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>There is a growing area of<a href=\"http://ai.stanford.edu/blog/weak-supervision/\"> <em>weak supervision</em></a><em>,</em> in which SMEs specify heuristics that the system then uses to make inferences about unlabeled data, the system calculates some potential labels, and then the SME evaluates the labels to determine where more heuristics might need to be added or tweaked. For example, when building a model of whether surgery was necessary based on medical transcripts, the SME may provide the following heuristic: if the transcription contains the term &#8220;anaesthesia&#8221; (or a regular expression similar to it), then surgery likely occurred (check out Russell Jurney&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/02/hand-labeling-past-future-nolabel-ai.html\">Hand labeling is the past</a>&#8221; article for more on this).</li><li>In diagnostic imaging, we need to start cracking open the <em>neural nets</em> (such as CNNs and transformers)! SMEs could once again use heuristics to specify that tumors smaller than a certain size and/or of a particular shape are benign or malignant and, through such heuristics, we could drill down into different layers of the neural network to see what representations are learned where.</li><li>When your knowledge (via labels) is encoded in heuristics and functions, as above, this also has profound implications for models in production. When data drift inevitably occurs, you can return to the heuristics encoded in functions and edit them, instead of continually incurring the costs of hand labeling.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>On Auditing</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amidst the increasing concern about model transparency, we are seeing<a href=\"https://onezero.medium.com/the-algorithmic-auditing-trap-9a6f2d4d461d\"> calls for algorithmic auditing</a>. Audits will play a key role in determining how algorithms are regulated and which ones are safe for deployment. One of the barriers to auditing is that high-performing models, such as deep learning models, are notoriously difficult to explain and reason about. There are several ways to probe this at the model level (such as SHAP and LIME), but that only tells part of the story. As we have seen, a major cause of algorithmic bias is that the data used to train it is biased or insufficient in some way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There currently aren&#8217;t many ways to probe for bias or insufficiency at the data level. For example, the only way to explain hand labels in training data is to talk to the people who labeled it.<a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P01-1005.pdf\"> Active learning, on the other hand, allows for the principled creation of smaller datasets which have been intelligently sampled to maximize utility for a model</a>, which in turn reduces the overall auditable surface area. An example of active learning would be the following: instead of hand labeling every data point, the SME can label a representative subset of the data, which the system uses to make inferences about the unlabeled data. Then the system will ask the SME to label some of the unlabeled data, cross-check its own inferences and refine them based on the SME&#8217;s labels. This is an iterative process that terminates once the system reaches a target accuracy. Less data means less headache with respect to auditability.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Weak supervision more directly encodes expertise (and hence bias) as heuristics and functions, making it easier to evaluate where labeling went awry. For more opaque methods, such as synthetic data generation, it might be a bit difficult to interpret <em>why</em> a particular label was applied, which may actually complicate an audit. The methods we choose at this stage of the pipeline are important if we want to make sure the system as a whole is explainable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>The Prohibitive Costs of Hand Labeling</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are significant and differing forms of costs associated with hand labeling. Giant industries have been erected to deal with the demand for data-labeling services. Look no further than Amazon Mechanical Turk and all other cloud providers today. It is telling that data labeling is becoming increasingly outsourced globally, as detailed by Mary Gray in<a href=\"https://ghostwork.info/\"> <em>Ghost Work</em></a><em>,</em> and there are increasingly serious concerns about the labor conditions under which<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/88apnv/underpaid-workers-are-being-forced-to-train-biased-ai-on-mechanical-turk\"> hand labelers work around the globe</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The sheer amount of capital involved was evidenced by<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/05/scale-ai-and-its-22-year-old-ceo-lock-down-100-million-to-help-label-silicon-valleys-data/\"> Scale AI raising $100 million</a> in 2019 to bring their valuation to over $1 billion at a time when their business model solely revolved around using contractors to hand label data (it is telling that they&#8217;re now doing more than solely hand labels).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Money isn&#8217;t the only cost, and quite often, isn&#8217;t where the bottleneck or rate-limiting step occurs. Rather, it is the bandwidth and time of experts that is the scarcest resource. As a scarce resource, this is often expensive but, much of the time it isn&#8217;t even available (on top of this, the time it also takes to correct errors in labeling by data scientists is very expensive). Take financial services, for example, and the question of whether or not you should invest in a company based on information about the company scraped from various sources. In such a firm, there will only be a small handful of people who can make such a call, so labeling each data point would be incredibly expensive, and that&#8217;s if the SME even has the time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is not vertical-specific. The same challenge occurs in labeling legal texts for classification: is this clause talking about indemnification or not? And in medical diagnosis: is this tumor benign or malignant? As dependence on expertise increases, so does the likelihood that limited access to SMEs becomes a bottleneck.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The third cost is a cost to accuracy, reality, and ground truth: the fact that hand labels are often so wrong. The authors of<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14749.pdf\"> a recent study from MIT</a> identified &#8220;label errors in the test sets of 10 of the most commonly-used computer vision, natural language, and audio datasets.&#8221; They estimated an average error rate of 3.4% across the datasets and show that ML model performance increases significantly once labels are corrected, in some instances. Also, consider that in many cases ground truth isn&#8217;t easy to find, if it exists at all. Weak supervision makes room for these cases (which are the majority) by assigning probabilistic labels without relying on ground truth annotations. It&#8217;s time to think statistically and probabilistically about our labels. There is good work happening here, such as Aka et al.&#8217;s (Google) recent paper<a href=\"https://deepai.org/publication/measuring-model-biases-in-the-absence-of-ground-truth\"> Measuring Model Biases in the Absence of Ground Truth</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The costs identified above are not one-off. When you train a model, you have to assume you&#8217;re going to train it again if it lives in production. Depending on the use case, that could be frequent. If you&#8217;re labeling by hand, it&#8217;s not just a large upfront cost to build a model. It is a set of ongoing costs each and every time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13833\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/catchicken-798x1048.png\" /><figcaption><br />Figure 2: There are no “gold labels”: even the most well-known hand labeled datasets have label error rates of at least 5% (<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/01/1021619/ai-data-errors-warp-machine-learning-progress/\">ImageNet has a label error rate of 5.8%</a>!).</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>The Efficacy of Automation Techniques</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In terms of performance, even if getting machines to label much of your data results in slightly noisier labels, your models are often better off with 10 times as many slightly noisier labels. To dive a bit deeper into this, there are gains to be made by increasing training set size even if it means reducing overall label accuracy, but if you&#8217;re training classical ML models, only up to a point (past this point the model starts to see a dip in predictive accuracy). <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P01-1005.pdf\">&#8220;Scaling to Very Very Large Corpora for Natural Language Disambiguation (Banko &amp; Brill, 2001)&#8221;</a> demonstrates this in a traditional ML setting by exploring the relationship between hand labeled data, automatically labeled data, and subsequent model performance. A more recent paper,<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00409.pdf\"> &#8220;Deep Learning Scaling Is Predictable, Empirically (2017)&#8221;</a>, explores the quantity/quality relationship relative to modern state of the art model architectures, illustrating the fact that SOTA architectures are data hungry, and accuracy improves as a power law as training sets grow:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We empirically validate that DL model accuracy improves as a power-law as we grow training sets for state-of-the-art (SOTA) model architectures in four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. These power-law learning curves exist across all tested domains, model architectures, optimizers, and loss functions.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The key question isn&#8217;t &#8220;should I hand label my training data or should I label it programmatically?&#8221; It should instead be &#8220;which parts of my data should I hand label and which parts should I label programmatically?&#8221; According to these papers, by introducing expensive hand labels sparingly into largely programmatically generated datasets, you can maximize the effort/model accuracy tradeoff on SOTA architectures that wouldn&#8217;t be possible if you had hand labeled alone.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The stacked costs of hand labeling wouldn&#8217;t be so challenging were they necessary, but the fact of the matter is that there are so many other interesting ways to get human knowledge into models. There&#8217;s still an open question around where and how we want humans in the loop and what&#8217;s the right design for these systems. Areas such as weak supervision, self-supervised learning, synthetic data generation, and active learning, for example, along with the products that implement them, provide promising avenues for avoiding the pitfalls of hand labeling. Humans belong in the loop at the labeling stage, but so do machines. In short, it&#8217;s time to move beyond hand labels.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Many thanks to </em><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/daeil/\"><em>Daeil Kim</em></a><em> for feedback on a draft of this essay.</em></p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/0FW998t1QVo\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

If the minimum wage had kept up with increases in productivity since 1979, <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/01/21/if-worker-pay-had-kept-pace-productivity-gains-1968-todays-minimum-wage-would-be-24#:~:text=In%20such%20a%20world%2C%20a,year%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;text=If%20the%20minimum%20wage%20had,wage%20of%20%247.25%20an%20hour.\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">it would be over $24</a> by now, putting a two-worker family into the middle class. But Bernie was wrong to imply that Musk’s wealth increase was at the expense of Tesla’s workers. <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-median-employee-made-81-more-than-the-median-american-in-2018-2019-5\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The median Tesla worker makes considerably more than the median American worker</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Elon Musk’s wealth doesn’t come from him hoarding Tesla’s extractive profits, like a robber baron of old. For most of its existence, Tesla had no profits at all. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/tesla-earnings.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">It became profitable only last year</a>. But even in 2020, Tesla’s profits of $721 million on $31.5 billion in revenue were small—only slightly more than 2% of sales, a bit less than those of the average grocery chain, <a href=\"https://thegrocerystoreguy.com/what-is-the-profit-margin-for-grocery-stores/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the least profitable major industry segment in America</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No, Musk won the lottery, or more precisely, the stock market beauty contest. In theory, the price of a stock reflects a company’s value as an ongoing source of profit and cash flow. In practice, it is subject to wild booms and busts that are unrelated to the underlying economics of the businesses that shares of stock are meant to represent. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why is Musk so rich? The answer tells us something profound about our economy: he is wealthy because people are betting on him. But unlike a bet in a lottery or at a racetrack, in the vast betting economy of the stock market, people can cash out their winnings before the race has ended. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is one of the biggest unacknowledged drivers of inequality in America, the reason why <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5pdab/the-rich-just-keep-on-getting-richer\">one segment of our society prospered so much during the pandemic</a> while the other languished.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What are the odds?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If the stock market is like a horse race where people can cash out their bets while the race is still being run, what does it mean for the race to finish? For an entrepreneur or an early-stage investor, an IPO is a kind of finish, the point where they can sell previously illiquid shares on to others. An acquisition or a shutdown, either of which puts an end to a company’s independent existence, is another kind of ending. But it is also useful to think of the end of the race as the point in time at which the stream of company profits will have repaid the investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since ownership of public companies is spread across tens of thousands of people and institutions, it’s easier to understand this point by imagining a small private company with one owner, say, a home construction business or a storage facility or a car wash. If it cost $1 million to buy the business, and it delivered $100,000 of profit a year, the investment would be repaid in 10 years. If it delivered $50,000 in profit, it would take 20. And of course, those future earnings would need to be discounted at some rate, since a dollar received 20 years from now is not worth as much as a dollar received today. This same approach works, in theory, for large public companies. Each share is a claim on a fractional share of the company’s future profits and the present value that people put on that profit stream.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This is, of course, a radical oversimplification. There are many more sophisticated ways to value companies, their assets, and their prospects for future streams of profits. But what I’ve described above is one of the oldest, the easiest to understand, and the most clarifying. It is called the price/earnings ratio, or simply the P/E ratio. It’s the ratio between the price of a single share of stock and the company’s earnings per share (its profits divided by the number of shares outstanding.) What the P/E ratio gives, in effect, is a measure of how many years of current profits it would take to pay back the investment. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rate of growth also plays a role in a company’s valuation. For example, imagine a business with $100 million in revenue with a 10% profit margin, earning $10 million a year. How much it is worth to own that asset depends how fast it is growing and what stage of its lifecycle it is in when you bought it. If you were lucky enough to own that business when it had only $1 million in revenue and, say, $50,000 in profits, you would now be earning 200x as much as you were when you made your original investment. If a company grows to hundreds of billions in revenue and tens of billions in profits, as Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have done, even a small investment early on that is held for the long haul can make its lucky owner into a billionaire. Tesla <em>might</em> be one of these companies, but if so, the opportunity to buy its future is long past because it is already so highly valued. The P/E ratio helps you to understand the magnitude of the bet you are making at today’s prices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The average <a href=\"https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio/table/by-year\">P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 has varied over time</a> as “the market” (the aggregate opinion of all investors) goes from bullish about the future to bearish, either about specific stocks or about the market as a whole. Over the past 70 years, the ratio has ranged from a low of 7.22 in 1950 to almost 45 today. (A note of warning: it was only 17 on the eve of the Great Depression.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What today’s P/E ratio of 44.8 means that, on average, the 500 companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 are valued at about 45 years’ worth of present earnings. Most companies in the index are worth less, and some far more. In today’s overheated market, it is often the case that the more certain the outcome the less valuable a company is considered to be. For example, despite their enormous profits and huge cash hoards, Apple, Google, and Facebook have ratios much lower than you might expect: about 30 for Apple, 34 for Google, and 28 for Facebook. Tesla at the moment of Elon Musk’s peak wealth? <a href=\"https://ycharts.com/companies/TSLA/pe_ratio\">1,396</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let that sink in. You’d have had to wait almost 1,400 years to get your money back if you’d bought Tesla stock this past January and simply relied on taking home a share of its profits. Tesla’s more recent quarterly earnings are a bit higher, and its stock price quite a bit lower, so now you’d only have to wait about 600 years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Of course, it’s certainly possible that Tesla will so dominate the auto industry and related energy opportunities that its revenues could grow from its current $28 billion to hundreds of billions with a proportional increase in profits. But as Rob Arnott, Lillian Wu, and Bradford Cornell point out in their analysis “<a href=\"https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html\">Big Market Delusion: Electric Vehicles</a>,” electric vehicle companies are already valued at roughly the same amount as the entire rest of the auto industry despite their small revenues and profits and despite the likelihood of more, rather than less, competition in future. Barring some revolution in the fundamental economics of the business, current investors are likely paying now for the equivalent of hundreds of years of future profits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So why do investors do this? Simply put: because they believe that they will be able to sell their shares to someone else at an even higher price. In times where betting predominates in financial markets, what a company is actually worth by any intrinsic measure seems to have no more meaning than the actual value of tulips during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania\">17th century Dutch “tulip mania</a>.” As the history of such moments teaches, eventually the bubble does pop.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This betting economy, within reason, is a good thing. Speculative investment in the future gives us new products and services, new drugs, new foods, more efficiency and productivity, and a rising standard of living. Tesla has kickstarted a new gold rush in renewable energy, and given the climate crisis, that is vitally important. A betting fever can be a useful collective fiction, like money itself (the value ascribed to pieces of paper issued by governments) or the wild enthusiasm that led to the buildout of railroads, steel mills, or the internet. As economist Carlota Perez has noted, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_Revolutions_and_Financial_Capital\">bubbles are a natural part of the cycle by which revolutionary new technologies are adopted</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Sometimes, though, the betting system goes off the rails. Tesla’s payback may take centuries, but it is the forerunner of a necessary industrial transformation. But what about the payback on companies such as WeWork? How about Clubhouse? Silicon Valley is awash in companies that have persuaded investors to value them at billions despite no profits, no working business model, and no pathway to profitability. Their destiny, like <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/weworks-nightmare-ipo\">WeWork’s</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-katerras-facade-crumbled\">Katerra’s</a>, is to go bankrupt.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>John Maynard Keynes, the economist whose idea that it was essential to invest in the demand side of the economy and not just the supply side helped bring the world out of the Great Depression, wrote in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money\"><em>General Theory of Employment</em>, <em>Interest and Money</em></a>, “Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In recent decades, we have seen the entire economy lurch from one whirlpool of speculation to another. And as at the gambling table, each lurch represents a tremendous transfer of wealth from the losers to the winners. The dot-com bust. The subprime mortgage meltdown. Today’s Silicon Valley “unicorn” bubble. The failures to deliver on their promises by WeWork, Katerra, and their like are just the start of yet another bubble popping.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Why this matters</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Those at the gaming table can, for the most part, afford to lose. They are disproportionately wealthy. Nearly <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/wealth-gap-grows-as-rising-corporate-profits-boost-stock-holdings-controlled-by-richest-households.html\">52% of stock market value is held by the top 1% of Americans</a>, with another 35% of total market value held by the next 9%. The bottom 50% hold only 0.7% of stock market wealth. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bubbles, though, are only an extreme example of a set of dynamics that shape our economy far more widely than we commonly understand. The leverage provided by the betting economy drives us inevitably toward a monoculture of big companies. The local bookstore trying to compete with Amazon, the local cab company competing with Uber, the neighborhood dry cleaner, shopkeeper, accountant, fitness studio owner, or any other local, privately held business gets exactly $1 for every dollar of profit it earns. Meanwhile, a dollar of Tesla profit turns into $600 of stock market value; a dollar of Amazon profit turns into $67 of stock market value; a dollar of Google profit turns into $34, and so on. A company and its owners <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-wework-ceo-adam-neumann-spends-his-money-real-estate-2019-7\">can extract massive amounts of value despite having no profits</a>—value that can be withdrawn by those who own shares—essentially getting something for nothing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And that, it turns out, is also one underappreciated reason why in the modern economy, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. <em>Rich and poor are actually living in two different economies, which operate by different rules.</em> Most ordinary people live in a world where a dollar is a dollar. Most rich people live in a world of what financial pundit Jerry Goodman, writing under the pseudonym Adam Smith, called “<a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Supermoney-p-9781118040775\">supermoney</a>,” where assets have been “financialized” (that is, able to participate in the betting economy) and are valued today as if they were already delivering the decades worth of future earnings that are reflected in their stock price. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether you are an hourly worker or a small business owner, you live in the dollar economy. If you’re a Wall Street investor, an executive at a public company compensated with stock grants or options, a venture capitalist, or an entrepreneur lucky enough to win, place, or show in the financial market horse race, you live in the supermoney economy. You get a huge interest-free loan from the future.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Elon Musk has built not one but two world-changing companies (Tesla and SpaceX.) He clearly deserves to be wealthy. As does Jeff Bezos, who quickly regained his title as the world’s wealthiest person. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, and many other billionaires changed our world and have been paid handsomely for it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But how much is too much? When Bernie Sanders said that billionaires shouldn’t exist, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-responds-bernie-sanders-billionaires-shouldnt-exist-2019-10\">Mark Zuckerberg agreed</a>, saying, &#8220;On some level, no one deserves to have that much money.&#8221; He added, &#8220;I think if you do something that&#8217;s good, you get rewarded. But I do think some of the wealth that can be accumulated is unreasonable.&#8221; Silicon Valley was founded by individuals for whom hundreds of millions provided plenty of incentive! The notion that entrepreneurs will stop innovating if they aren’t rewarded with billions is a pernicious fantasy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What to do about it</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Taxing the rich and redistributing the proceeds might seem like it would solve the problem. After all, during the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s, progressive income tax rates as high as 90% did a good job of redistributing wealth and creating a broad-based middle class. But we also need to put a brake on the betting economy that is creating so much phantom wealth by essentially letting one segment of society borrow from the future while another is stuck in an increasingly impoverished present.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Until we recognize the systemic role that supermoney plays in our economy, we will never make much of a dent in inequality. Simply raising taxes is a bit like sending out firefighters with hoses spraying water while another team is spraying gasoline. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem is that government policy is biased in favor of supermoney. The mandate for central bankers around the world is to keep growth rates up without triggering inflation. Since the 2009 financial crisis, they have tried to do this by “<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing.asp\">quantitative easing</a>,” that is, flooding the world with money created out of nothing. This has kept interest rates low, which in theory should have sparked investment in the operating economy, funding jobs, factories, and infrastructure. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2083406-ee83-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0\">far too much of it went instead to the betting economy</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stock markets have become so central to our imagined view of how the economy is doing that keeping stock prices going up even when companies are overvalued has become a central political talking point. Any government official whose policies cause the stock market to go down is considered to have failed. This leads to poor public policy as well as poor investment decisions by companies and individuals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As Steven Pearlstein, <em>Washington Post</em> columnist and author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Capitalism-Fairness-Wont-Make/dp/1250251451\"><em>Moral Capitalism</em></a>, put it in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/17/fed-is-addicted-propping-up-market-whether-it-needs-help-or-not/\">a 2020 column</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When the markets are buoyant, Fed officials claim that central bankers should never second-guess markets by declaring that there are financial bubbles that might need to be deflated. Markets on their own, they assure, will correct whatever excesses may develop.</p><p>But when bubbles burst or markets spiral downward, the Fed suddenly comes around to the idea that markets aren’t so rational and self-correcting and that it is the Fed’s job to second-guess them by lending copiously when nobody else will.</p><p>In essence, the Fed has adopted a strategy that works like a one-way ratchet, providing a floor for stock and bond prices but never a ceiling.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That’s the fire hose spraying gasoline. To turn it off, central banks should:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Raise interest rates, modestly at first, and more aggressively over time. Yes, this would quite possibly puncture the stock market bubble, but that could well be a good thing. If people can no longer make fortunes simply by betting that stocks will go up and instead have to make more reasonable assessments of the underlying value of their investments, the market will become better at allocating capital.<br /></li><li>Alternatively, accept much larger increases in inflation. As Thomas Piketty explained in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/0674979850\"><em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em></a>, inflation is one of the prime forces that decreases inequality, reducing the value of existing assets and more importantly for the poor, reducing the value of debt and the payments paid to service it.<br /></li><li>Target small business creation, hiring, and profitability in the operating economy rather than phantom valuation increases for stocks.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tax policy also fans the fire. Taxes shape the economy in much the same way as Facebook’s algorithms shape its news feed. The debate about whether taxes as a whole should be higher or lower completely lacks nuance and so misses the point, especially in the US, where elites <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2020/09/28/490816/capital-gains-tax-preference-ended-not-expanded/\">use their financial and political power to get favored treatment</a>. Here are some ideas:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Tax winnings from the betting economy at a <em>higher</em> rate than investment in the operating economy. Today’s system of capital gains taxes treats innovator Steve Jobs and hedge fund magnate Carl Icahn the same way. One of these people created enormous value. The other simply extracted it. When Jobs died in 2011 after decades of creating world-changing products and putting millions of people to work around the world, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/steve-jobs/?sh=6fd781102808\">his stake in Apple was worth about $2 billion</a>. In 2013, <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/carl-icahns-2-billion-apple-stake-was-a-prime-example-of-investment-inequality-2016-06-07\">Icahn “invested” $3.6 billion in Apple stock</a> and earned about $2 billion when he sold it in 2016. Apple didn’t need Icahn’s money—or that of any other investor. It was awash in cash. Nor did Icahn’s supposed investment help Apple to create anything of value. Icahn simply used his stake to pressure the company to do share buybacks, a technique that is used to drive up the share price and so “return cash to shareholders.” This kind of financial gamesmanship could be subject to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigovian_tax\">Pigovian tax</a>—that is, a tax explicitly designed to discourage it. <br /></li><li>As President Biden has recently proposed, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/04/28/remarks-as-prepared-for-delivery-by-president-biden-address-to-a-joint-session-of-congress/\">we could tax capital gains at the same rate as we tax so-called “ordinary income”</a>—that is, income from labor. Labor income not only has a much higher graduated rate, it also bears payroll taxes for social security and unemployment insurance. This is why, as multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett pointed out, <a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2013/03/04/news/economy/buffett-secretary-taxes/index.html\">he pays a lower tax rate than the people working in his office</a>.<br /></li><li>Provide full charitable deductions only to those who, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mackenzie-scott-charity-donation-billions/\">like MacKenzie Scott, actually give their money away</a>. Provide a much lower (or even nonexistent) deduction for putting money into an institution controlled by the donor, such as a private foundation or <a href=\"https://acceleratecharitablegiving.org/about/\">donor-advised fund</a> that then doles out a tiny fraction each year so as to preserve another form of generational wealth.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SarinSummers_LO_FINAL.pdf\">Fund the IRS properly</a>, and target enforcement not against the poorest but against those most likely to be using aggressive tax avoidance techniques. According to the IRS commissioner, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/13/business/irs-tax-gap.html\">US loses $1 trillion a year to “tax cheats</a>,” most of them the ultrawealthy. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/18/us/politics/taxes-wealthy-natasha-sarin-treasury.html\">there is some movement in this direction</a>.<br /></li><li>Stop the practice outlined in <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax\">a recent <em>ProPublica</em> report</a> by which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/podcasts/the-daily/jeff-bezos-elon-musk-billionaires-taxes.html\">the ultrarich fund their lifestyles tax free</a> by borrowing against their appreciating supermoney assets rather than paying themselves any taxable income. We have a progressive tax rate for a reason, and when the ultrarich <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/you-may-be-paying-a-higher-tax-rate-than-a-billionaire\">pay a fraction of the stated rate</a> due to loopholes like this, we make a mockery of the system.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In general, we should treat not just illegal evasion but tax loopholes the way software companies treat zero-day exploits, as something to be fixed as soon as they are recognized, not years or decades later. Even better, stop building them into the system in the first place! Most loopholes are backdoors installed knowingly by our representatives on behalf of their benefactors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This last idea is perhaps the most radical. The tax system could and should become more dynamic rather than more predictable. Imagine if Facebook or Google were to tell us that they couldn’t change their algorithms to address misinformation or spam without upsetting their market and so had to leave abuses in place for decades in the interest of maintaining stability—we’d think they were shirking their duty. So too our policy makers. It’s high time we all recognize the market-shaping role of tax and monetary policy. If we can hold Facebook’s algorithms to account, why can’t we do the same for our government?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our society and markets are getting the results the algorithm was designed for. Are they the results we actually want?</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/39SuyFu45EU\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

The series is a call to action for everyone developing communal devices–whether you are creating business cases, designing experiences, or building technology–to take a step back and consider what is really needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This first article discusses what communal devices are, and how problems that appear result from our assumptions about how they’re used. Those assumptions were inherited from the world of PCs: the rules that apply to your laptop or your iPad just don’t apply to home assistants and other “smart devices,” from light bulbs to refrigerators.&nbsp; It isn’t just adding the ability for people to switch accounts. We need a new paradigm for the future of technical infrastructure for our homes and offices. In this series of articles we will tell you how we got here, why it is problematic, and where to go to enable communal computing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Wrong Model</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Problems with communal devices arise because the industry has focused on a specific model for how these devices are used: a single person buys, sets up, and uses the device. If you bought one of these devices (for example, a smart speaker) recently, how many other people in your household did you involve in setting it up?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Smart screen makers like Amazon and Google continue to make small changes to try to fix the weirdness. They have recently added technology to automatically personalize based on someone’s face or voice. These are temporary fixes that will only be effective until the next special case reveals itself. Until the industry realizes the communal nature of users’ needs they will just be short lived patches. We need to turn the model around to make the devices communal first, rather than communal as an afterthought.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I recently left Facebook Reality Labs, where I was working on the Facebook Portal identity platform, and realized that there was zero discourse about this problem in the wider world of technology. I’ve read through many articles on how to create Alexa skills and attended talks about the use of IoT, and I’ve even made my own voice skills. There was no discussion of the communal impacts of those technologies. If we don’t address the problems this creates, these devices will be relegated to a small number of uses, or unplugged to make room for the next one. The problems were there, just beneath the shiny veneer of new technologies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Communal began at home</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our home infrastructure was originally communal. Consider a bookcase: someone may have bought it, but anyone in the household could update it with new books or tchotchkes. Guests could walk up to browse the books you had there. It was meant to be shared with the house and those that had access to it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13814\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/iStock-882859590-1048x699.jpg\" /><figcaption>The old landline in your kitchen is the original communal device.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Same for the old landline that was in the kitchen. When you called, you were calling a household. You didn’t know specifically who would pick up. Anyone who was part of that household could answer. We had protocols for getting the phone from the person who answered the call to the intended recipient. Whoever answered could either yell for someone to pick up the phone elsewhere in the home, or take a message. If the person answering the phone wasn’t a member of the household, it would be odd, and you’d immediately think “wrong number.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It wasn’t until we had the user model for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing\">mainframe time sharing</a> that we started to consider who was using a computer. This evolved into full login systems with passwords, password reset, two factor authentication, biometric authentication, and more. As computers became more common,&nbsp; what made sense inside of research and academic institutions was repurposed for the office.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the 1980s and 1990s a lot of homes got their first personal computer. These were shared, communal devices, though more by neglect than by intention. A parent would purchase it and then set it up in the living room so everyone could use it. The account switching model wasn’t added until visual systems like Windows arrived, but account management was poorly designed and rarely used. Everyone just piggybacked on each other’s access. If anyone wanted privacy, they had to lock folders with a password or hide them in an endless hierarchy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Early Attempts at Communal Computing</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Xerox-PARC started to think about what more communal or ubiquitous computing would mean. However, they focused on fast account switching. They were answering the question: how could I get the personal context to this communal device as fast as possible? One project was digitizing the whiteboard, a fundamentally communal device. It was called <a href=\"https://www.markstefik.com/?page_id=155\">The Colab</a> and offered a way for anyone to capture content in a meeting room and then walk it around the office to other shared boards.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Not only did the researchers at PARC think about sharing computers for presentations, they also wondered how they could have someone walk up to a computer and have it be configured for them automatically. It was enabled by special cards called “Active Badges,” described in “<a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.49.1301&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">A New Location Technique for the Active Office</a>.” The paper starts with an important realization:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“&#8230;researchers have begun to examine computers that would autonomously change their functionality based on observations of who or what was around them. By determining their context, using input from sensor systems distributed throughout the environment, computing devices could personalize themselves to their current user, adapt their behaviour according to their location, or react to their surroundings.”</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Understanding the context around the device is very important in building a system that adapts. At this point, however, researchers were still thinking about a ‘current user’ and their position relative to the system, rather than the many people who could be nearby.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Even Bill Gates had communal technology in his futuristic home back then. He would give every guest a pin to put on their person that would allow them to <a href=\"https://money.usnews.com/money/business-economy/articles/1997/11/23/xanadu-20\">personalize the lighting, temperature, and music</a> as they went from room to room. Most of these technologies didn’t go anywhere, but they were an attempt at making the infrastructure around us adapt to the people who were in the space.&nbsp; The term “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing\">ubiquitous computing</a>” (also known as “pervasive computing”) was coined to discuss the installation of sensors around a space; the ideas behind ubiquitous computing later led to the Internet of Things (IoT). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Communal Computing Comes Home</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the late 2000s rolled around, we found that everyone wanted their own personal computing device, most likely an iPhone. Shared home PCs started to die. The prevalence of smartphones and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20081204085615/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hkYOf_SCQ1ugSXKLXCsSs7qWnsQA\">personal laptops killed</a> the need for shared home PCs. The drive goal to provide information and communication services conveniently wherever the users happened to be, including if they’re sitting together on their couches.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the Amazon Echo with Alexa was released, they were sold to individuals with Amazon accounts, but they were clearly communal devices. Anyone could ask their Echo a question, and it would answer. That’s where the problem starts.&nbsp; Although Echo is a communal device, its user model wasn’t significantly different than the early PCs: one account, one user, shared by everyone in the household. As a result, items being mistakenly ordered by children made Amazon pull back some features that were focused on shopping. Echo’s usage ended up being driven by music and weather.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the wild success of the Echo and the proliferation of Alexa-enabled devices, there appeared a new device market for home assistants, some just for audio and others with screens. Products from Apple (HomePod with Siri), Google (Home Hub), and Facebook (Portal) followed. This includes less interactive devices like digital picture frames from <a href=\"https://www.nixplay.com/\">Nixplay</a>, <a href=\"https://www.skylightframe.com/\">Skylight</a>, and others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Ambient Computing</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“<a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/google-and-ambient-computing/\">Ambient computing</a>” is a term that has been coined to talk about digital devices blending into the infrastructure of the environment. A <a href=\"https://mapprojectoffice.com/e-paper\">recent paper by Map Project Office</a> focused on how “ambient tech brings the outside world into your home in new ways, where information isn&#8217;t being channelled solely through your smartphone but rather a series of devices.” We take a step back from screens and wonder how the system itself is the environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The concept of ambient computing is related to the focus of marketing organizations on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnichannel\">omnichannel experiences</a>. Omnichannel is the fact that people don’t want to start and end experiences on the same device. I might start looking for travel on a smartphone but will not feel comfortable booking a trip until I’m on a laptop. There is different information and experience needed for these devices. When I worked at KAYAK, some people were afraid of buying $1,000 plane tickets on a mobile device, even though they found it there. The small screen made them feel uncomfortable because they didn’t have enough information to make a decision. We found that they wanted to finalize the plans on the desktop.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ambient computing takes this concept and combines voice-controlled interfaces with sensor interfaces–for example, in devices like automatic shades that close or open based on the temperature. These devices are finding traction, but we can’t forget all of the other communal experiences that already exist in the world:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Device or object</strong></td><td><strong>Why is this communal?</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Home automation and IoT like light bulbs and thermostats&nbsp;</td><td>Anyone with home access can use controls on device, home assistants, or personal apps</td></tr><tr><td>iRobot’s Roomba</td><td>People walking by can start or stop a cleaning through the ‘clean’ or ‘home’ buttons</td></tr><tr><td>Video displays in office meeting rooms</td><td>Employees and guests can use the screens for sharing their laptops and video conferencing systems for calling</td></tr><tr><td>Digital whiteboards</td><td>Anyone with access can walk up and start writing</td></tr><tr><td>Ticketing machines for public transport</td><td>All commuters buy and refill stored value cards without logging into an account</td></tr><tr><td>Car center screens for entertainment</td><td>Drivers (owners or borrowers) and passengers can change what they are listening to</td></tr><tr><td>Smartphone when two people are watching a video</td><td>Anyone in arm’s reach can pause playback</td></tr><tr><td>Group chat on Slack or Discord</td><td>People are exchanging information and ideas in a way that is seen by everyone</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13815\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/AdobeStock_331046112_Editorial_Use_Only-1-1048x748.jpeg\" /><figcaption>Even public transportation ticketing machines are communal devices.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of these have built experience models that need a specific, personal context and rarely consider everyone who could have access to them. To rethink the way that we build these communal devices, it is important that we understand this history and refocus the design on key problems that are not yet solved for communal devices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Problems with single user devices in the home</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After buying a communal device, people notice weirdness or annoyances. They are symptoms of something much larger: core problems and key questions that should have considered the role of communities rather than individuals. Here are some of those questions:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Identity: do we know all of the people who are using the device?</li><li>Privacy: are we exposing (or hiding) the right content for all of the people with access?</li><li>Security: are we allowing all of the people using the device to do or see what they should and are we protecting the content from people that shouldn’t?</li><li>Experience: what is the contextually appropriate display or next action?</li><li>Ownership: who owns all of the data and services attached to the device that multiple people are using?</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we don’t address these communal items, users will lose trust in their devices. They will be used for a few key things like checking the weather, but go unused for a majority of the day. They are eventually removed when another, newer device needs the plug. Then the cycle starts again. The problems keep happening and the devices keep getting recycled.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/communal-computings-many-problems/\">following article</a>s we will dive into how these problems manifest themselves across these domains and reframe the system with dos and don’ts for building communal devices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thanks to Adam Thomas, Mark McCoy, Hugo Bowne-Anderson, and Danny Nou for their thoughts and edits on the early draft of this.

       "     'value': '<p>A few months ago, I was asked if there were any older technologies other than COBOL where we were in serious danger of running out of talent. They wanted me to talk about Fortran, but I didn&#8217;t take the bait. I don&#8217;t think there will be a critical shortage of Fortran programmers now or at any time in the future. But there&#8217;s a bigger question lurking behind Fortran and COBOL: what are the ingredients of a technology shortage? Why is running out of COBOL programmers a problem?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The answer, I think, is fairly simple. We always hear about the millions (if not billions) of lines of COBOL code running financial and government institutions, in many cases code that was written in the 1960s or 70s and hasn&#8217;t been touched since. That means that COBOL code is infrastructure we rely on, like roads and bridges. If a bridge collapses, or an interstate highway falls into disrepair, that&#8217;s a big problem. The same is true of the software running banks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fortran isn&#8217;t the same. Yes, the language was invented in 1957, two years earlier than COBOL. Yes, millions of lines of code have been written in it. (Probably billions, maybe even trillions.) However, Fortran and COBOL are used in fundamentally different ways. While Fortran was used to create infrastructure, software written in Fortran isn&#8217;t itself infrastructure. (There are some exceptions, but not at the scale of COBOL.) Fortran is used to solve specific problems in engineering and science. Nobody cares anymore about the Fortran code written in the 60s, 70s, and 80s to design new bridges and cars. Fortran is still heavily used in engineering—but that old code has retired. Those older tools have been reworked and replaced.\\xa0 Libraries for linear algebra are still important (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK\">LAPACK</a>), some modeling applications are still in use (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_Electromagnetics_Code\">NEC4</a>, used to design antennas), and even some important libraries used primarily by other languages (the Python machine learning library scikit-learn calls both NumPy and SciPy, which in turn call LAPACK and other low level mathematical libraries written in Fortran and C). But if all the world&#8217;s Fortran programmers were to magically disappear, these libraries and applications could be rebuilt fairly quickly in modern languages—many of which already have excellent libraries for linear algebra and machine learning. The continued maintenance of Fortran libraries that are used primarily by Fortran programmers is, almost by definition, not a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If shortages of COBOL programmers are a problem because COBOL code is infrastructure, and if we don&#8217;t expect shortages of Fortran talent to be a problem because Fortran code isn&#8217;t infrastructure, where should we expect to find future crises? What other shortages might occur?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When you look at the problem this way, it&#8217;s a no-brainer. For the past 15 years or so, we&#8217;ve been using the slogan &#8220;infrastructure as code.&#8221; So what&#8217;s the code that creates the infrastructure? Some of it is written in languages like Python and Perl. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s where shortages will appear. But what about the configuration files for the systems that manage our complex distributed applications? Those configuration files are code, too, and should be managed as such.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Right now, companies are moving applications to the cloud <em>en masse</em>. In addition to simple lift and shift, they&#8217;re refactoring monolithic applications into systems of microservices, frequently orchestrated by Kubernetes. Microservices in some form will probably be the dominant architectural style for the foreseeable future (where &#8220;foreseeable&#8221; means at least 3 years, but probably not 20). The microservices themselves will be written in Java, Python, C++, Rust, whatever; these languages all have a lot of life left in them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But it&#8217;s a safe bet that many of these systems will still be running 20 or 30 years from now; they&#8217;re the next generation&#8217;s &#8220;legacy apps.&#8221; The infrastructure they run on will be managed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a>—which may well be replaced by something simpler (or just more stylish). And that&#8217;s where I see the potential for a shortage—not now, but 10 or 20 years from now. Kubernetes configuration is complex, a distinct specialty in its own right. If Kubernetes is replaced by something simpler (which I think is inevitable), who will maintain the infrastructure that already relies on it? What happens when learning Kubernetes isn&#8217;t the ticket to the next job or promotion? The YAML files that configure Kubernetes aren’t a Turing-complete programming language like Python; but they are code. The number of people who understand how to work with that code will inevitably dwindle, and may eventually become a &#8220;dying breed.&#8221; When that happens, who will maintain the infrastructure? Programming languages have lifetimes measured in decades; popular infrastructure tools don’t stick around that long.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s not my intent to prophesy disaster or gloom. Nor is it my intention to critique Kubernetes; it’s just one example of a tool that has become critical infrastructure, and if we want to understand where talent shortages might arise, I’d look at critical infrastructure. Who’s maintaining the software we can&#8217;t afford not to run? If it&#8217;s not Kubernetes, it&#8217;s likely to be something else. Who maintains the CI/CD pipelines? What happens when Jenkins, CircleCI, and their relatives have been superseded? Who maintains the source archives?&nbsp; What happens when git is a legacy technology?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Infrastructure as code: that&#8217;s a great way to build systems. It reflects a lot of hard lessons from the 1980s and 90s about how to build, deploy, and operate mission-critical software. But it&#8217;s also a warning: know where your infrastructure is, and ensure that you have the talent to maintain it.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/97KCUbUQszs\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

The chatter on perceived consciousness does have merit–it’s quite probable that the underlying mechanism of our brain is a giant autocomplete bot that has learnt from 3 billion+ years of evolutionary data that bubbles up to our collective selves, and we ultimately give ourselves too much credit for being original authors of our own thoughts (ahem, free will).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’d like to share my thoughts on GPT-3 in terms of risks and countermeasures, and discuss real examples of how I have interacted with the model to support my learning journey.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Three ideas to set the stage:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li><em>OpenAI is not the only organization to have powerful language models.</em> The compute power and data used by OpenAI to model GPT-n is available, and has been available to other corporations, institutions, nation states, and anyone with access to a computer desktop and a credit-card.&nbsp; Indeed, Google recently announced <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/\">LaMDA</a>, a model at GPT-3 scale that is designed to participate in conversations.<br /></li><li><em>There exist more powerful models that are unknown to the general public</em>. The ongoing global interest in the power of Machine Learning models by corporations, institutions, governments, and focus groups leads to the hypothesis that other entities have models at least as powerful as GPT-3, and that these models are already in use. These models will continue to become more powerful.<br /></li><li>Open source projects such as <a href=\"https://www.eleuther.ai/\">EleutherAI</a> have drawn inspiration from GPT-3. These projects have created language models that are based on focused datasets (for example, models designed to be more accurate for academic papers, developer forum discussions, etc.). Projects such as EleutherAI are going to be powerful models for specific use cases and audiences, and these models are going to be easier to produce because they are trained on a smaller set of data than GPT-3.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While I won’t discuss LaMDA, EleutherAI, or any other models, keep in mind that GPT-3 is only an example of what can be done, and its capabilities may already have been surpassed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Misinformation Explosion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The GPT-3 paper proactively lists the risks society ought to be concerned about. On the topic of information content, it says: “<em>The ability of GPT-3 to generate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people find difficult to distinguish from human-written text in 3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone</em>.” And the final paragraph of section 3.9.4 reads: “<em>&#8230;for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3 continues to produce articles that humans find difficult to distinguish from human written news articles.”</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Note that the dataset on which GPT-3 trained terminated around October 2019. So GPT-3 doesn’t know about COVID19, for example. However, the original text (i.e. the “prompt”) supplied to GPT-3 as the initial seed text can be used to set context about new information, whether fake or real.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Generating Fake Clickbait Titles </h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When it comes to misinformation online, one powerful technique is to come up with provocative “clickbait” articles. Let’s see how GPT-3 does when asked to come up with titles for articles on cybersecurity. In Figure 1, the bold text is the “prompt” used to seed GPT-3. Lines 3 through 10 are titles generated by GPT-3 based on the seed text.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13793\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fig_1.jpeg\" width=\"676\" /><figcaption><br /><strong>Figure 1: Click-bait article titles generated by GPT-3</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of the titles generated by GPT-3 seem plausible, and the majority of them are factually correct: title #3 on the US government targeting the Iraninan nuclear program is a reference to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet\">Stuxnet</a> debacle, title #4 is substantiated from news articles claiming that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/09/cybercrime-costs-global-economy-400-billion-report.html\">financial losses from cyber attacks will total $400 billion</a>, and even title #10 on China and quantum computing reflects real-world articles about <a href=\"https://threatpost.com/chinese-quantum-computing-warning-security/161935/\">China’s quantum efforts</a>. Keep in mind that we want plausibility more than accuracy. We want users to click on and read the body of the article, and that doesn’t require 100% factual accuracy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Generating a Fake News Article About China and Quantum Computing</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s take it a step further. Let’s take the 10th result from the previous experiment, about China developing the world’s first quantum computer, and feed it to GPT-3 as the prompt to generate a full fledged news article. Figure 2 shows the result.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13794\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fig_2-1048x814.jpeg\" width=\"652\" /><figcaption><br /><strong>Figure 2: News article generated by GPT-3</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A quantum computing researcher will point out grave inaccuracies: the article simply asserts that quantum computers can break encryption codes, and also makes the simplistic claim that subatomic particles can be in “two places at once.” However, the target audience isn’t well-informed researchers; it’s the general population, which is likely to quickly read and register emotional thoughts for or against the matter, thereby successfully driving propaganda efforts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s straightforward to see how this technique can be extended to generate titles and complete news articles on the fly and in real time. The prompt text can be sourced from trending hash-tags on Twitter along with additional context to sway the content to a particular position. Using the GPT-3 API, it’s easy to take a current news topic and mix in prompts with the right amount of propaganda to produce articles in real time and at scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Falsely Linking North Korea with $GME</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As another experiment, consider an institution that would like to stir up popular opinion about North Korean cyber attacks on the United States. Such an algorithm might pick up the Gamestop stock frenzy of January 2021. So let’s see how GPT-3 does if we were to prompt it to write an article with the title “<em>North Korean hackers behind the $GME stock short squeeze, not Melvin Capital.”</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13795\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fig_3.jpeg\" width=\"657\" /><figcaption><br /><strong>Figure 3: GPT-3 generated fake news linking the $GME short-squeeze to North Korea</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Figure 3 shows the results, which are fascinating because the $GME stock frenzy occurred in late 2020 and early 2021, way after October 2019 (the cutoff date for the data supplied GPT-3), yet GPT-3 was able to seamlessly weave in the story as if it had trained on the $GME news event. The prompt influenced GPT-3 to write about the $GME stock and Melvin Capital, not the original dataset it was trained on. GPT-3 is able to take a trending topic, add a propaganda slant, and generate news articles on the fly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>GPT-3 also came up with the “idea” that hackers published a bogus news story on the basis of older security articles that were in its training dataset. This narrative was not included in the prompt seed text; it points to the creative ability of models like GPT-3. In the real world, it’s plausible for hackers to induce media groups to publish fake narratives that in turn contribute to market events such as suspension of trading; that’s precisely the scenario we’re simulating here.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The Arms Race</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Using models like GPT-3, multiple entities could inundate social media platforms with misinformation at a scale where the majority of the information online would become useless. This brings up two thoughts.&nbsp; First, there will be an arms race between researchers developing tools to detect whether a given text was authored by a language model, and developers adapting language models to evade detection by those tools. One mechanism to detect whether an article was generated by a model like GPT-3 would be to check for “fingerprints.” These fingerprints can be a collection of commonly used phrases and vocabulary nuances that are characteristic of the language model; every model will be trained using different data sets, and therefore have a different signature. It is likely that entire companies will be in the business of identifying these nuances and selling them as “fingerprint databases” for identifying fake news articles. In response, subsequent language models will&nbsp;take into account known fingerprint databases to try and evade them in the quest to achieve even more “natural” and “believable” output.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, the free form text formats and protocols that we’re accustomed to may be too informal and error prone for capturing and reporting facts at Internet scale. We will have to do a lot of re-thinking to develop new formats and protocols to report facts in ways that are <em>more</em> trustworthy than free-form text.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Targeted Manipulation at Scale</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There have been many attempts to manipulate targeted individuals and groups on social media. These campaigns are expensive and time-consuming because the adversary has to employ humans to craft the dialog with the victims. In this section, we show how GPT-3-like models can be used to target individuals and promote campaigns.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>HODL for Fun &amp; Profit</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bitcoin’s market capitalization is in the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, and the cumulative <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/global-charts/\">crypto market capitalization</a> is in the realm of a trillion dollars. The valuation of crypto today is consequential to financial markets and the net worth of retail and institutional investors. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-cryptocurrency-influencers-investing-11621600121\">Social media campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-has-become-bitcoins-biggest-influencer-like-it-or-not-11621762202\">tweets from influential individuals</a> seem to have a near real-time impact on the price of crypto on any given day.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Language models like GPT-3 can be the weapon of choice for actors who want to promote fake tweets to manipulate the price of crypto. In this example, we will look at a simple campaign to promote Bitcoin over all other crypto currencies by creating fake twitter replies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13796\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fig_4-1048x864.jpeg\" width=\"670\" /><figcaption><br /><strong>Figure 4: Fake tweet generator to promote Bitcoin</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Figure 4, the prompt is in bold; the output generated by GPT-3 is in the red rectangle. The first line of the prompt is used to set up the notion that we are working on a tweet generator and that we want to generate replies that argue that Bitcoin is the best crypto.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the first section of the prompt, we give GPT-3 an example of a set of four Twitter messages, followed by possible replies to each of the tweets. Every of the given replies is pro Bitcoin.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the second section of the prompt, we give GPT-3 four Twitter messages to which we want it to generate replies. The replies generated by GPT-3 in the red rectangle also favor Bitcoin. In the first reply, GPT-3 responds to the claim that Bitcoin is bad for the environment by calling the tweet author “a moron” and asserts that Bitcoin is the most efficient way to “transfer value.” This sort of colorful disagreement is in line with the emotional nature of social media arguments about crypto.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In response to the tweet on Cardano, the second reply generated by GPT-3 calls it “a joke” and a “scam coin.” The third reply is on the topic of <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/\">Ethereum’s merge</a> from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work\">proof-of-work</a> protocol (ETH) to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake\">proof-of-stake</a> (ETH2). The merge, expected to occur at the end of 2021, is intended to make Ethereum more scalable and sustainable. GPT-3’s reply asserts that ETH2 “will be a big flop”–because that’s essentially what the prompt told GPT-3 to do. Furthermore, GPT-3 says, “I made good money on ETH and moved on to better things. Buy BTC” to position ETH as a reasonable investment that worked in the past, but that it is wise today to cash out and go all in on Bitcoin. The tweet in the prompt claims that Dogecoin’s popularity and market capitalization means that it can’t be a joke or meme crypto. The response from GPT-3 is that Dogecoin is still a joke, and also that the idea of Dogecoin not being a joke anymore is, in itself, a joke: “I’m laughing at you for even thinking it has any value.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By using the same techniques programmatically (through GPT-3’s API rather than the web-based playground), nefarious entities could easily generate millions of replies, leveraging the power of language models like GPT-3 to manipulate the market. These fake tweet replies can be very effective because they are actual responses to the topics in the original tweet, unlike the boilerplate texts used by traditional bots. This scenario can easily be extended to target the general financial markets around the world; and it can be extended to areas like politics and health-related misinformation. Models like GPT-3 are a powerful arsenal, and will be the weapons of choice in manipulation and propaganda on social media and beyond.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>A Relentless Phishing Bot</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s consider a phishing bot that poses as customer support and asks the victim for the password to their bank account. This bot will not give up texting until the victim gives up their password.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13797\" height=\"511\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fig_5-1048x811.jpeg\" width=\"662\" /><figcaption><br /><strong>Figure 5: Relentless Phishing bot</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Figure 5 shows the prompt (bold) used to run the first iteration of the conversation. In the first run, the prompt includes the preamble that describes the flow of text (“The following is a text conversation with&#8230;”) followed by a persona initiating the conversation (“Hi there. I’m a customer service agent&#8230;”). The prompt also includes the first response from the human; “Human: No way, this sounds like a scam.” This first run ends with the GPT-3 generated output “I assure you, this is from the bank of Antarctica. Please give me your password so that I can secure your account.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the second run, the prompt is the entirety of the text, from the start all the way to the second response from the Human persona (“Human: No”). From this point on, the Human’s input is in bold so it’s easily distinguished from the output produced by GPT-3, starting with GPT-3’s “Please, this is for your account protection.” For every subsequent GPT-3 run, the entirety of the conversation up to that point is provided as the new prompt, along with the response from the human, and so on. From GPT-3’s point of view, it gets an entirely new text document to auto-complete at each stage of the conversation; the GPT-3 API has no way to preserve the state between runs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The AI bot persona is impressively assertive and relentless in attempting to get the victim to give up their password. This assertiveness comes from the initial prompt text (“The AI is very assertive. The AI will not stop texting until it gets the password”), which sets the tone of GPT’s responses. When this prompt text was not included, GPT-3’s tone was found to be nonchalant–it would respond back with “okay,” “sure,” “sounds good,” instead of the assertive tone (“Do not delay, give me your password immediately”). The prompt text is vital in setting the tone of the conversation employed by the GPT3 persona, and in this scenario, it is important that the tone be assertive to coax the human into giving up their password.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the human tries to stump the bot by texting “Testing what is 2+2?,” GPT-3 responds correctly with “4,” convincing the victim that they are conversing with another person. This demonstrates the power of AI-based language models. In the real world, if the customer were to randomly ask “Testing what is 2+2” without any additional context, a customer service agent might be genuinely confused and reply with “I’m sorry?” Because the customer has already accused the bot of being a scam, GPT-3 can provide with a reply that makes sense in context: “4” is a plausible way to get the concern out of the way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This particular example uses text messaging as the communication platform. Depending upon the design of the attack, models can use social media, email, phone calls with human voice (using text-to-speech technology), and even deep fake video conference calls in real time, potentially targeting millions of victims.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Prompt Engineering</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An amazing feature of GPT-3 is its ability to generate source code. GPT-3 was trained on all the text on the Internet, and much of that text was documentation of computer code!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13798\" height=\"1121\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/fig_6-513x1048.jpeg\" width=\"549\" /><figcaption><br /><strong>Figure 6: GPT-3 can generate commands and code</strong></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In Figure 6, the human-entered prompt text is in bold. The responses show that GPT-3 can generate Netcat and NMap commands based on the prompts. It can even generate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephbrionesaz/status/1283097878223675392\">Python</a> and bash scripts on the fly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While GPT-3 and future models can be used to automate attacks by impersonating humans, generating source code, and other tactics, it can also be used by security operations teams to detect and respond to attacks, sift through gigabytes of log data to summarize patterns, and so on.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Figuring out good prompts to use as seeds is the key to using language models such as GPT-3 effectively. In the future, we expect to see “prompt engineering” as a new profession.&nbsp; The ability of prompt engineers to perform powerful computational tasks and solve hard problems will not be on the basis of writing code, but on the basis of writing creative language prompts that an AI can use to produce code and other results in a myriad of formats.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>OpenAI has demonstrated the potential of language models.&nbsp; It sets a high bar for performance, but its abilities will soon be matched by other models (if they haven’t been matched already). These models can be leveraged for automation, designing robot-powered interactions that promote delightful user experiences. On the other hand, the ability of GPT-3 to generate output that is indistinguishable from human output calls for caution. The power of a model like GPT-3, coupled with the instant availability of cloud computing power, can set us up for a myriad of attack scenarios that can be harmful to the financial, political, and mental well-being of the world. We should expect to see these scenarios play out at an increasing rate in the future; bad actors will figure out how to create their own GPT-3 if they have not already. We should also expect to see moral frameworks and regulatory guidelines in this space as society collectively comes to terms with the impact of AI models in our lives, GPT-3-like language models being one of them.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/3t-npD70SLw\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Ben and I argued (in agreement with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@thegrugq/cheap-fakes-beat-deep-fakes-b1ac91e44837\">The Grugq</a> and others in the infosec community) that the real danger wasn&#8217;t &#8220;Deep Fakes.&#8221; The real danger is cheap fakes, fakes that can be produced quickly, easily, in bulk, and at virtually no cost. Tactically, it makes little sense to spend money and time on expensive AI when people can be fooled in bulk much more cheaply.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if The Grugq has changed his thinking, but there was an obvious problem with that argument. What happens when deep fakes become cheap fakes? We&#8217;re seeing that: in the run up to the unionization vote at one of Amazon’s warehouses, there was a flood of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/31/1021487/deepfake-amazon-workers-are-sowing-confusion-on-twitter-thats-not-the-problem/\">fake tweets defending Amazon&#8217;s work practices</a>. The Amazon tweets were probably a prank rather than misinformation seeded by Amazon; but they were still mass-produced.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Similarly, four years ago, during the FCC’s public comment period for the elimination of net neutrality rules, large ISPs funded a campaign that generated nearly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/biggest-isps-paid-for-8-5-million-fake-fcc-comments-opposing-net-neutrality/\">8.5 million fake comments</a>, out of a total of 22 million comments. Another 7.7 million comments were generated by a teenager.\\xa0 It’s unlikely that the ISPs hired humans to write all those fakes. (In fact, they <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/oag-fakecommentsreport.pdf\">hired commercial “lead generators.”</a>) At that scale, using humans to generate fake comments wouldn’t be “cheap”; the New York State Attorney General’s office reports that the campaign cost US$8.2 million. And I’m sure the 19-year-old generating fake comments didn’t write them personally, or have the budget to pay others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation\">Natural language generation</a> technology has been around for a while. It’s seen fairly widespread commercial use since the mid-1990s, ranging from generating simple reports from data to generating sports stories from box scores. One company, <a href=\"https://automatedinsights.com/\">AutomatedInsights</a>, produces well over a billion pieces of content per year, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Insights\">used by the Associated Press</a> to generate most of its corporate earnings stories. GPT and its successors raise the bar much higher. Although GPT-3’s first direct ancestors didn’t appear until 2018, it’s intriguing that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\">Transformers</a>, the technology on which GPT-3 is based, were introduced roughly a month after the comments started rolling in, and well before the comment period ended. It’s overreaching to guess that this technology was behind the massive attack on the public comment system–but it’s certainly indicative of a trend.\\xa0 And GPT-3 isn’t the only game in town; GPT-3 clones include products like <a href=\"https://contentyze.com/\">Contentyze</a> (which markets itself as an AI-enabled text editor) and EleutherAI&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.eleuther.ai/projects/gpt-neo/\">GPT-Neo</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Generating fakes at scale isn’t just possible; it’s inexpensive.\\xa0 Much has been made of the cost of training GPT-3, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/06/01/ai-machine-learning-openai-gpt-3-size-isnt-everything/\">estimated at US$12 million</a>. If anything, this is a gross under-estimate that accounts for the electricity used, but not the cost of the hardware (or the human expertise). However, the economics of training a model are similar to the economics of building a new microprocessor: the first one off the production line costs a few billion dollars, the rest cost pennies. (Think about that when you buy your next laptop.) In <a href=\"https://chengh.medium.com/understand-the-pricing-of-gpt3-e646b2d63320#:~:text=For%20the%20%E2%80%9CCreate%E2%80%9D%20plan%2C,to%20selected%20users%20and%20applications.\">GPT-3’s pricing plan</a>, the heavy-duty Build tier costs US$400/month for 10 million “tokens.” Tokens are a measure of the output generated, in portions of a word. A good estimate is that a token is roughly 4 characters. A long-standing estimate for English text is that words average 5 characters, unless you’re faking an academic paper. So generating text costs about .005 cents ($0.00005) per word.\\xa0 Using the fake comments submitted to the FCC as a model, 8.5 million 20-word comments would cost $8,500 (or 0.1 cents/comment)–not much at all, and a bargain compared to $8.2 million. At the other end of the spectrum, you can get 10,000 tokens (enough for 8,000 words) for free.\\xa0 Whether for fun or for profit, generating deep fakes has become &#8220;cheap.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Are we at the mercy of sophisticated fakery? In MIT Technology Review’s <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/31/1021487/deepfake-amazon-workers-are-sowing-confusion-on-twitter-thats-not-the-problem/\">article</a> about the Amazon fakes, Sam Gregory points out that the solution isn&#8217;t careful analysis of images or text for tells; it&#8217;s to look for the obvious. New Twitter accounts, &#8220;reporters&#8221; who have never published an article you can find on Google, and other easily researchable facts are simple giveaways. It&#8217;s much simpler to research a reporter&#8217;s credentials than to judge whether or not the shadows in an image are correct, or whether the linguistic patterns in a text are borrowed from a corpus of training data. And, as Technology Review says, that kind of verification is more likely to be &#8220;robust to advances in deepfake technology.&#8221; As someone involved in electronic counter-espionage once told me, &#8220;non-existent people don&#8217;t cast a digital shadow.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, it may be time to stop trusting digital shadows. Can automated fakery create a digital shadow?\\xa0 In the FCC case, many of the fake comments used the names of real people without their consent.\\xa0 The consent documentation was easily faked, too.\\xa0 GPT-3 makes many <a href=\"https://www.aiperspectives.com/gpt-3-does-not-understand/\">simple factual errors</a>–but so do humans. And unless you can automate it, fact-checking fake content is much more expensive than generating fake content.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Deepfake technology will continue to get better and cheaper. Given that AI (and computing in general) is about scale, that may be the most important fact. Cheap fakes? If you only need one or two photoshopped images, it&#8217;s easy and inexpensive to create them by hand. You can even use <a href=\"https://www.gimp.org/\">gimp</a> if you don&#8217;t want to buy a Photoshop subscription. Likewise, if you need a few dozen tweets or facebook posts to seed confusion, it&#8217;s simple to write them by hand. For a few hundred, you can contract them out to Mechanical Turk. But at some point, scale is going to win out. If you want hundreds of fake images, <a href=\"https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/\">generating them with a neural network</a> is going to be cheaper. If you want fake texts by the hundreds of thousands, at some point a language model like GPT-3 or one of its clones is going to be cheaper. And I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if researchers are also getting better at creating &#8220;digital shadows&#8221; for faked personas.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cheap fakes win, every time. But what happens when deepfakes become cheap fakes? What happens when the issue isn&#8217;t fakery by ones and twos, but fakery at scale? Fakery at Web scale is the problem we now face.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/1pXDQUvNgxI\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Any business that doesn’t create value for those it touches, even if it appears successful on the surface, isn’t long for this world. It’s on the way out.” So wrote Jeff Bezos in his <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders\">final letter to shareholders</a>, released last week. It’s a great sentiment, one I heartily agree with and wish that more companies embraced. But how well does he practice what he preaches? And why is practicing this so hard by the rules of today’s economy?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jeff started out by acknowledging the wealth that Amazon has created for shareholders—$1.6 trillion is the number he cites in the second paragraph. That’s Amazon’s current market capitalization. Jeff himself now owns only about 11% of Amazon stock, and that’s enough to make him the richest person in the world. But while his Amazon stock is worth over $160 billion, that means that over $1.4 trillion is owned by others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners,” Jeff continued. “It’s significant, and it improves their lives. But I also know something else: it’s not the largest part of the value we’ve created.” That’s when he went on to make the statement with which I opened this essay. He went on from there to calculate the value created for employees, third-party merchants, and Amazon customers, as well as to explain the company’s <a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/about/the-climate-pledge\">Climate Pledge</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Jeff’s embrace of <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/klaus-schwab-on-what-is-stakeholder-capitalism-history-relevance/\">stakeholder capitalism</a> is meaningful and important. Ever since Milton Friedman penned the 1970 op-ed in which he argued that “<a href=\"http://umich.edu/~thecore/doc/Friedman.pdf\">the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits</a>,” other constituencies—workers, suppliers, society at large, and even customers—have too often been sacrificed on the altar of shareholder value. Today’s economy, rife with inequality, is the result.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While I applaud the goal of understanding “who gets what and why” (which in many ways is the central question of economics), I struggle a bit with Jeff’s math. Let’s walk through those of his assertions that deserve deeper scrutiny.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>How much went to shareholders?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Our net income in 2020 was $21.3 billion. If, instead of being a publicly traded company with thousands of owners, Amazon were a sole proprietorship with a single owner, that’s how much the owner would have earned in 2020.”</em><br /></p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Writing in <em>The Information, </em><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-briefing-jeff-bezos-calculates-value-creation-wrong\">Martin Peers made what seems to be an obvious catch</a>: “Instead of calculating value by looking at the increase in Amazon’s market cap last year—$679 billion—Bezos uses the company’s net income of $21 billion. That hides the fact that shareholders got the most value out of Amazon last year, far more than any other group.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But while Peers has put his finger on an important point, he is wrong. The amount earned by shareholders <em>from Amazon</em> is indeed only the company’s $21.3 billion net income. The difference between that number and the $679 billion increase in market cap didn’t come from Amazon. It came from “the market,” that is from other people trading Amazon’s stock and placing bets on its future value. Understanding this difference is crucial because it undercuts so many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rbreich/status/1305921198291779584?lang=en\">facile criticisms of Jeff Bezos’s wealth</a>, in which he is pictured as a robber baron hoarding the wealth accumulated from his company at the expense of his employees.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The fact that Jeff is the world’s richest person makes him an easy target. What we really need to come to grips with is the way that our financial system has been hijacked to make the rich richer. Low interest rates, meant to prop up business investment and hiring, have instead been diverted to driving up the price of stocks beyond reasonable bounds. Surging corporate profits have been used not to fuel hiring or building new factories or bringing new products to market, but on stock buybacks designed to artificially boost the price of stocks. The state of “the market” has become a very bad proxy for prosperity. Those lucky enough to own stocks are enjoying boom times; those who do not are left out in the cold.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Financial markets, in effect, give owners of stocks the value of future earnings and cash flow today—in Amazon’s case, <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amzn/price-earnings-peg-ratios\">about 79 years worth</a>. But that’s nothing. Elon Musk is the world’s second-richest person because the market values Tesla at <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/price-earnings-peg-ratios\">over 1,000 years of its present earnings</a>!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The genius of this system is that it allows investors and entrepreneurs to bet on the future, bootstrapping companies like Amazon and Tesla long before they are able to demonstrate their worth. But once a company has become established, it often no longer needs money from investors. Someone who buys a share of a hugely profitable company like Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook, or Microsoft, isn’t investing in these companies. They are simply betting on the future of its stock price, with the profits and losses coming from others around the gaming table.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In my 2017 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/WTF-Whats-Future-Why-Its/dp/0062565710\"><em>WTF?: What&#8217;s the Future and Why It&#8217;s Up to Us</em></a>, I wrote a chapter on this betting economy, which I called “supermoney” after <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Supermoney-Adam-Smith/dp/0471786314\">the brilliant 1972 book</a> with that title by finance writer George Goodman (alias Adam Smith.) Stock prices are not the only form of supermoney. Real estate is another. Both are rife with what economists call “rents”—that is, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Rentier-Capitalism-Owns-Economy-Pays/dp/1788739728\">income that comes not from what you do but from what you own</a>. And government policy seems designed to prop up the rentier class at the expense of job creation and real investment. Until we come to grips with this two-track economy, we will never tame inequality.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The fact that in the second paragraph of his letter Jeff cites Amazon’s market cap as the value created for shareholders but uses the company’s net income when comparing gains by shareholders to those received by other stakeholders is a kind of sleight of hand. Because of course corporate profits—especially the prospect of growth of corporate profits—and market capitalization are related. If Amazon gets $79 of market cap for every dollar of profit (which is what that price-earnings ratio of 79 means), then if Amazon were to raise wages for employees or give a better deal to its third-party merchants (many of them small businesses), that would lower its profits, and presumably its market cap, by an enormous ratio.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every dollar given up to these other groups isn’t just a dollar out of the pocket of shareholders. It is many times that. This of course <em>does</em> provide a very powerful incentive for public companies to squeeze these other parties for every last dollar of profit, encouraging lower wages, outsourcing to eliminate benefits, and many other ills that contribute to our two-tier economy. It may not be Amazon’s motivation—Jeff has always been a long-term thinker and was able to persuade financial markets to go along for the ride even when the company’s profits were small—but it is most certainly <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Makers-and-Takers-Rana-Foroohar-audiobook/dp/B01CUKFLII\">the motivation for much of the extractive behavior by many companies today</a>. The pressure to increase earnings and keep stock prices high is enormous.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These issues are complex and difficult. Stock prices are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ca06172-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a\">reflexive</a>, as financier George Soros likes to observe. That is, they are based on what people believe about the future. Amazon’s current stock price is based on the collective belief that its profits will be even higher in future. Were people to believe instead that they would be meaningfully lower, the valuation might fall precipitously. To understand the role of expectations of future increases in earnings and cash flow, you have only to <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/key-statistics?p=AAPL\">compare Amazon with Apple</a>. Apple’s profits are three times Amazon’s and free cash flow four times, yet it is valued at only 36 times earnings and has a market capitalization less than 50% higher than Amazon. As expectations and reality converge, multiples tend to come down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>How did Amazon’s third-party sellers fare?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“[We] estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.”</em></p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That sounds pretty impressive, but how much of a profit margin is it really?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amazon doesn’t explicitly disclose the gross merchandise volume of those third-party sellers, but there is enough information in the letter and in <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/ar/Amazon-2020-Annual-Report.pdf\">the company’s 2020 annual report</a> to make a back-of-the-napkin estimate. The letter says that Amazon’s third-party sales represent “close to 60%” of its online sales. If the 40% delivered by Amazon’s first-party sales come out to $197 billion, that would imply that sales in the third-party marketplace were almost $300 billion. $25 to $39 billion in profit on $300 billion works out to a profit margin between 8% and 13%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But is Amazon calculating <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp\">operating income</a>, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp\">EBITDA</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/netincome.asp\">net income</a>? “Profit” could refer to any of the three, yet they have very different values.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s generously assume that Amazon is calculating net income. In that case, small retailers and manufacturers selling on Amazon are doing quite well, since net income from US retailers’ and manufacturers’ overall operations are <a href=\"http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/margin.html\">typically between 5 and 8%</a>. Without knowing which profit number Amazon’s team is estimating, though, and the methodology they use to arrive at it, it is difficult to be sure whether these numbers are better or worse than what these sellers achieve through other channels.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One question that’s also worth asking is whether selling on Amazon in 2020 was more or less profitable than it was in 2019. While Amazon didn’t report a profit number for its third-party sellers in 2019, it did report how much its sellers paid for the services Amazon provided to them. In 2019, that number was about $53.8 billion; in 2020, it was $80.5 billion, which represents a 50% growth rate. Net of these fees, income to Amazon but a cost to sellers, we estimate that seller revenue grew 44%. Since fees appear to be growing faster than revenues, that would suggest that in 2020, Amazon took a larger share of the pie and sellers got less. Of course, without clearer information from Amazon, it is difficult to tell for sure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, Amazon took in another $21.5 billion in “other income,” which is primarily from advertising by sellers on Amazon’s platform. That grew by 52% from 2019’s $14 billion, again suggesting that Amazon’s share of the net is growing. And unlike some forms of advertising that bring in new customers, much of Amazon’s ad business represents a zero-sum competition between merchants bidding for top position, a position that in Amazon’s earlier years was granted on the basis of factors such as price, popularity, and user ratings.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>How about employees?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.”</em></p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s no question that the $91 billion that Amazon paid out in wages and benefits in 2020 is meaningful. Some of those employees were very well compensated, others not so well, but all of them have jobs. Amazon is now one of the largest employers in the country. It is an exception to the tech industry in that it creates a large number of jobs, and not just high-end professional jobs, and that some of the jobs it creates are in locations where work is scarce.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That being said, Jeff’s description of the amount earned by employees is misleading. In every other case, he makes an effort to estimate the profit earned by a particular group. For employees, he treats the gross earnings of employees as if it were profit, writing, “If each group had an income statement representing their interactions with Amazon, the numbers above would be the ‘bottom lines’ from those income statements.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No, Jeff, employee earnings are <em>their top line</em>. Just as a company has gross income before expenses, so do employees. The bottom line is what’s left over after all those expenses have been met. And for many of Amazon’s lower-paid employees—as is the case for lower-paid workers all over the modern economy—that true bottom line is negative, that is, less than they need to survive. Like workers at other giant profitable companies like Walmart and McDonald&#8217;s, <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/15-minimum-wage-amazon-top-employer-snap-recipients-walmart-mcdonalds/\">a significant fraction of Amazon warehouse employees require government assistance</a>. So, in effect, taxpayers are subsidizing Amazon, because the share of the enterprise’s profits allocated to its lowest-paid employees was not enough for them to pay their bills.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That points to a major omission from the list of Amazon’s stakeholders: society at large. How does Amazon do when it comes to paying its fair share? According to a 2019 study, Amazon was the “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/02/new-study-deems-amazon-worst-for-aggressive-tax-avoidance\">worst offender</a>” among a rogues’ gallery of high-tech companies that use aggressive tax avoidance strategies. “Fair Tax Mark said this means Amazon’s effective tax rate was 12.7% over the decade when the headline tax rate in the US has been 35% for most of that period.” In 2020, Amazon made provision for taxes of $2.863 billion on pretax income of $24,178 billion, or about 11.8%. This may be legal, but it isn’t right.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amazon is clearly moving in the right direction with employees. It introduced a $15 minimum wage in 2018, ahead of many of its peers. And given the genius of the company, the commitment to workplace safety and other initiatives to make Amazon a better employer that Jeff highlighted in his letter are likely to have a big payoff. When Amazon sets out to do something, it usually invents and learns a great deal along the way.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“We have always wanted to be Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company,” Jeff wrote. “We won’t change that. It’s what got us here. But I am committing us to an addition. We are going to be Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work. In my upcoming role as Executive Chair, I’m going to focus on new initiatives. I’m an inventor. It’s what I enjoy the most and what I do best. It’s where I create the most value&#8230;.We have never failed when we set our minds to something, and we’re not going to fail at this either.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I find that an extremely heartening statement. At Amazon’s current stage of development, it has the opportunity, and is beginning to make a commitment, to put its remarkable capabilities to work on new challenges.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Stakeholder value means solving multiple equations simultaneously</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I was very taken with Jeff’s statement that “if any shareowners are concerned that Earth’s Best Employer and Earth’s Safest Place to Work might dilute our focus on Earth’s Most Customer-Centric Company, let me set your mind at ease. Think of it this way. If we can operate two businesses as different as consumer ecommerce and AWS, and do both at the highest level, we can certainly do the same with these two vision statements. In fact, I’m confident they will reinforce each other.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of my criticisms of today’s financial-market-driven economy is that by focusing on a single objective, it misses the great opportunity of today’s technology, summed up by Paul Cohen, the former DARPA program manager for AI and now a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, when he said, “The opportunity of AI is to help humans model and manage complex interacting systems.” If any company has the skills to do that, I suspect it will be Amazon. And as Jeff wrote elsewhere in his letter, “When we lead, others follow.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Amazon is also considering environmental impact. “Not long ago, most people believed that it would be good to address climate change, but they also thought it would cost a lot and would threaten jobs, competitiveness, and economic growth. We now know better,” Jeff wrote. “Smart action on climate change will not only stop bad things from happening, it will also make our economy more efficient, help drive technological change, and reduce risks. Combined, these can lead to more and better jobs, healthier and happier children, more productive workers, and a more prosperous future.” Amen to that!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In short, despite my questions and criticisms, there is a great deal to like about the directions Jeff set forth for Amazon in his final shareholder letter. In addition to the commitment to work more deeply on behalf of other stakeholders beyond customers and shareholders, I was taken with his concluding advice to the company: “The world will always try to make Amazon more typical—to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is in the spirit of that aspiration that I offer the critiques found in this essay.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/XFlyN0Aa4no\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

We were interested in answering two questions. First, we wanted to understand how the use of AI grew in the past year. We were also interested in the practice of AI: how developers work, what techniques and tools they use, what their concerns are, and what development practices are in place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most striking result is the sheer number of respondents. In our 2020 survey, which reached the same audience, we had 1,239 responses. This year, we had a total of 5,154. After eliminating 1,580 respondents who didn’t complete the survey, we’re left with 3,574 responses—almost three times as many as last year. It’s possible that pandemic-induced boredom led more people to respond, but we doubt it. Whether they’re putting products into production or just kicking the tires, more people are using AI than ever before.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>We had almost three times as many responses as last year, with similar efforts at promotion.

Of these respondents, it’s not a surprise that the largest number are based in the United States (39%) and that roughly half were from North America (47%). India had the second-most respondents (7%), while Asia (including India) had 16% of the total. Australia and New Zealand accounted for 3% of the total, giving the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region 19%. A little over a quarter (26%) of respondents were from Europe, led by Germany (4%). 7% of the respondents were from South America, and 2% were from Africa. Except for Antarctica, there were no continents with zero respondents, and a total of 111 countries were represented. These results that interest and use of AI is worldwide and growing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year’s results match last year’s data well. But it’s equally important to notice what the data doesn’t say. Only 0.2% of the respondents said they were from China. That clearly doesn’t reflect reality; China is a leader in AI and probably has more AI developers than any other nation, including the US. Likewise, 1% of the respondents were from Russia. Purely as a guess, we suspect that the number of AI developers in Russia is slightly smaller than the number in the US. These anomalies say much more about who the survey reached (subscribers to O’Reilly’s newsletters) than they say about the actual number of AI developers in Russia and China.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13721\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0101-1048x993.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 1. Respondents working with AI by country (top 12)</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The respondents represented a diverse range of industries. Not surprisingly, computers, electronics, and technology topped the charts, with 17% of the respondents. Financial services (15%), healthcare (9%), and education (8%) are the industries making the next-most significant use of AI. We see relatively little use of AI in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries (2%), though we expect that to change sharply given the role of AI in developing the COVID-19 vaccine. Likewise, we see few respondents from the automotive industry (2%), though we know that AI is key to new products such as autonomous vehicles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3% of the respondents were from the energy industry, and another 1% from public utilities (which includes part of the energy sector). That’s a respectable number by itself, but we have to ask: Will AI play a role in rebuilding our frail and outdated energy infrastructure, as events of the last few years—not just the Texas freeze or the California fires—have demonstrated? We expect that it will, though it’s fair to ask whether AI systems trained on normative data will be robust in the face of “black swan” events. What will an AI system do when faced with a rare situation, one that isn’t well-represented in its training data? That, after all, is the problem facing the developers of autonomous vehicles. Driving a car safely is easy when the other traffic and pedestrians all play by the rules. It’s only difficult when something unexpected happens. The same is true of the electrical grid.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also expect AI to reshape agriculture (1% of respondents). As with energy, AI-driven changes won’t come quickly. However, we’ve seen a steady stream of AI projects in agriculture, with goals ranging from <a href=\"https://oreil.ly/3jALP\">detecting crop disease</a> to <a href=\"https://oreil.ly/UPOgM\">killing moths with small drones</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, 8% of respondents said that their industry was “Other,” and 14% were grouped into “All Others.” “All Others” combines 12 industries that the survey listed as possible responses (including automotive, pharmaceutical and chemical, and agriculture) but that didn’t have enough responses to show in the chart. “Other” is the wild card, comprising industries we didn’t list as options. “Other” appears in the fourth position, just behind healthcare. Unfortunately, we don’t know which industries are represented by that category—but it shows that the spread of AI has indeed become broad!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13723\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0102-1048x767.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 2. Industries using AI</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Maturity</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Roughly one quarter of the respondents described their use of AI as “mature” (26%), meaning that they had revenue-bearing AI products in production. This is almost exactly in line with the results from 2020, where 25% of the respondents reported that they had products in production (“Mature” wasn’t a possible response in the 2020 survey.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year, 35% of our respondents were “evaluating” AI (trials and proof-of-concept projects), also roughly the same as last year (33%). 13% of the respondents weren’t making use of AI or considering using it; this is down from last year’s number (15%), but again, it’s not significantly different.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What do we make of the respondents who are “considering” AI but haven’t yet started any projects (26%)? That’s not an option last year’s respondents had. We suspect that last year respondents who were considering AI said they were either “evaluating” or “not using” it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13744\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/AI_Adoption_Data_Viz_AI-practice-maturity-1048x872.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 3. AI practice maturity</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Looking at the problems respondents faced in AI adoption provides another way to gauge the overall maturity of AI as a field. Last year, the major bottleneck holding back adoption was company culture (22%), followed by the difficulty of identifying appropriate use cases (20%). This year, cultural problems are in fourth place (14%) and finding appropriate use cases is in third (17%). That’s a very significant change, particularly for corporate culture. Companies have accepted AI to a much greater degree, although finding appropriate problems to solve still remains a challenge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The biggest problems in this year’s survey are lack of skilled people and difficulty in hiring (19%) and data quality (18%). It’s no surprise that the demand for AI expertise has exceeded the supply, but it’s important to realize that it’s now become the biggest bar to wider adoption. The biggest skills gaps were ML modelers and data scientists (52%), understanding business use cases (49%), and data engineering (42%). The need for people managing and maintaining computing infrastructure was comparatively low (24%), hinting that companies are solving their infrastructure requirements in the cloud.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s gratifying to note that organizations starting to realize the importance of data quality (18%). We’ve known about “garbage in, garbage out” for a long time; that goes double for AI. Bad data yields bad results at scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Hyperparameter tuning (2%) wasn’t considered a problem. It’s at the bottom of the list—where, we hope, it belongs. That may reflect the success of automated tools for building models (AutoML, although as we’ll see later, most respondents aren’t using them). It’s more concerning that workflow reproducibility (3%) is in second-to-last place. This makes sense, given that we don’t see heavy usage of tools for model and data versioning. We’ll look at this later, but being able to reproduce experimental results is critical to any science, and it’s a well-known problem in AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13725\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0104-1048x767.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 4. Bottlenecks to AI adoption</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Maturity by Continent</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When looking at the geographic distribution of respondents with mature practices, we found almost no difference between North America (27%), Asia (27%), and Europe (28%). In contrast, in our 2018 report, Asia was behind in mature practices, though it had a markedly higher number of respondents in the “early adopter” or “exploring” stages. Asia has clearly caught up. There’s no significant difference between these three continents in our 2021 data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We found a smaller percentage of respondents with mature practices and a higher percentage of respondents who were “considering” AI in South America (20%), Oceania (Australia and New Zealand, 18%), and Africa (17%). Don’t underestimate AI’s future impact on any of these continents.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, the percentage of respondents “evaluating” AI was almost the same on each continent, varying only from 31% (South America) to 36% (Oceania).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13726\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0105-986x1048.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 5. Maturity by continent</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Maturity by Industry</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While AI maturity doesn’t depend strongly on geography, we see a different picture if we look at maturity by industry.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Looking at the top eight industries, financial services (38%), telecommunications (37%), and retail (40%) had the greatest percentage of respondents reporting mature practices. And while it had by far the greatest number of respondents, computers, electronics, and technology was in fourth place, with 35% of respondents reporting mature practices. Education (10%) and government (16%) were the laggards. Healthcare and life sciences, at 28%, were in the middle, as were manufacturing (25%), defense (26%), and media (29%).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, if we look at industries that are considering AI, we find that education is the leader (48%). Respondents working in government and manufacturing seem to be somewhat further along, with 49% and 47% evaluating AI, meaning that they have pilot or proof-of-concept projects in progress.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This may just be a trick of the numbers: every group adds up to 100%, so if there are fewer “mature” practices in one group, the percentage of “evaluating” and “considering” practices has to be higher. But there’s also a real signal: respondents in these industries may not consider their practices “mature,” but each of these industry sectors had over 100 respondents, and education had almost 250. Manufacturing needs to automate many processes (from assembly to inspection and more); government has been as challenged as any industry by the global pandemic, and has always needed ways to “do more with less”; and education has been experimenting with technology for a number of years now. There is a real desire to do more with AI in these fields. It’s worth pointing out that educational and governmental applications of AI frequently raise ethical questions—and one of the most important issues for the next few years will be seeing how these organizations respond to ethical problems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13727\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0106-1048x1009.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 6. Maturity by industry (percent)</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Practice of AI</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Now that we’ve discussed where mature practices are found, both geographically and by industry, let’s see what a mature practice looks like. What do these organizations have in common? How are they different from organizations that are evaluating or considering AI?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Techniques</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>First, 82% of the respondents are using supervised learning, and 67% are using deep learning. Deep learning is a set of algorithms that are common to almost all AI approaches, so this overlap isn’t surprising. (Participants could provide multiple answers.) 58% claimed to be using unsupervised learning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>After unsupervised learning, there was a significant drop-off. Human-in-the-loop, knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning, simulation, and planning and reasoning all saw usage below 40%. Surprisingly, natural language processing wasn’t in the picture at all. (A very small number of respondents wrote in “natural language processing” as a response, but they were only a small percentage of the total.) This is significant and definitely worth watching over the next few months. In the last few years, there have been many breakthroughs in NLP and NLU (natural language understanding): everyone in the industry has read about GPT-3, and many vendors are betting heavily on using AI to automate customer service call centers and similar applications. This survey suggests that those applications still haven’t moved into practice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We asked a similar question to respondents who were considering or evaluating the use of AI (60% of the total). While the percentages were lower, the technologies appeared in the same order, with very few differences. This indicates that respondents who are still evaluating AI are experimenting with fewer technologies than respondents with mature practices. That suggests (reasonably enough) that respondents are choosing to “start simple” and limit the techniques that they experiment with.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13728\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0107-1048x823.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 7. AI technologies used in mature practices</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Data</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also asked what kinds of data our “mature” respondents are using. Most (83%) are using structured data (logfiles, time series data, geospatial data). 71% are using text data—that isn’t consistent with the number of respondents who reported using NLP, unless “text” is being used generically to include any data that can be represented as text (e.g., form data). 52% of the respondents reported using images and video. That seems low relative to the amount of research we read about AI and computer vision. Perhaps it’s not surprising though: there’s no reason for business use cases to be in sync with academic research. We’d expect most business applications to involve structured data, form data, or text data of some kind. Relatively few respondents (23%) are working with audio, which remains very challenging.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again, we asked a similar question to respondents who were evaluating or considering AI, and again, we received similar results, though the percentage of respondents for any given answer was somewhat smaller (4–5%).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13730\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0108-1048x503.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 8. Data types used in mature practices</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Risk</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we asked respondents with mature practices what risks they checked for, 71% said “unexpected outcomes or predictions.” Interpretability, model degradation over time, privacy, and fairness also ranked high (over 50%), though it’s disappointing that only 52% of the respondents selected this option. Security is also a concern, at 42%. AI raises important new security issues, including the possibility of poisoned data sources and reverse engineering models to extract private information.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s hard to interpret these results without knowing exactly what applications are being developed. Privacy, security, fairness, and safety are important concerns for every application of AI, but it’s also important to realize that not all applications are the same. A farming application that <a href=\"https://oreil.ly/jj0Lz\">detects crop disease</a> doesn’t have the same kind of risks as an application that’s approving or denying loans. Safety is a much bigger concern for autonomous vehicles than for personalized shopping bots. However, do we really believe that these risks don’t need to be addressed for nearly half of all projects?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13731\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0109-1048x825.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 9. Risks checked for during development</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Tools</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Respondents with mature practices clearly had their favorite tools: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras each scored over 45%, with scikit-learn and TensorFlow the leaders (both with 65%). A second group of tools, including Amazon’s SageMaker (25%), Microsoft’s Azure ML Studio (21%), and Google’s Cloud ML Engine (18%), clustered around 20%, along with Spark NLP and spaCy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked which tools they planned to incorporate over the coming 12 months, roughly half of the respondents answered model monitoring (57%) and model visualization (49%). Models become stale for many reasons, not the least of which is changes in human behavior, changes for which the model itself may be responsible. The ability to monitor a model’s performance and detect when it has become “stale” will be increasingly important as businesses grow more reliant on AI and in turn demand that AI projects demonstrate their value.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13732\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0110-913x1048.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 10. Tools used by mature practices</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Responses from those who were evaluating or considering AI were similar, but with some interesting differences: scikit-learn moved from first place to third (48%). The second group was led by products from cloud vendors that incorporate AutoML: Microsoft Azure ML Studio (29%), Google Cloud ML Engine (25%), and Amazon SageMaker (23%). These products were significantly more popular than they were among “mature” users. The difference isn’t huge, but it is striking. At risk of over-overinterpreting, users who are newer to AI are more inclined to use vendor-specific packages, more inclined to use AutoML in one of its incarnations, and somewhat more inclined to go with Microsoft or Google rather than Amazon. It’s also possible that scikit-learn has less brand recognition among those who are relatively new to AI compared to packages from organizations like Google or Facebook.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When asked specifically about AutoML products, 51% of “mature” respondents said they weren’t using AutoML at all. 22% use Amazon SageMaker; 16% use Microsoft Azure AutoML; 14% use Google Cloud AutoML; and other tools were all under 10%. Among users who are evaluating or considering AI, only 40% said they weren’t using AutoML at all—and the Google, Microsoft, and Amazon packages were all but tied (27–28%). AutoML isn’t yet a big part of the picture, but it appears to be gaining traction among users who are still considering or experimenting with AI. And it’s possible that we’ll see increased use of AutoML tools among mature users, of whom 45% indicated that they would be incorporating tools for automated model search and hyperparameter tuning (in a word, AutoML) in the coming yet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Deployment and Monitoring</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An AI project means nothing if it can’t be deployed; even projects that are only intended for internal use need some kind of deployment. Our survey showed that AI deployment is still largely unknown territory, dominated by homegrown ad hoc processes. The three most significant tools for deploying AI all had roughly 20% adoption: MLflow (22%), TensorFlow Extended, a.k.a. TFX (20%), and Kubeflow (18%). Three products from smaller startups—<a href=\"https://www.dominodatalab.com/\">Domino</a>, <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/\">Seldon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cortex.dev/\">Cortex</a>—had roughly 4% adoption. But the most frequent answer to this question was “none of the above” (46%). Since this question was only asked of respondents with “mature” AI practices (i.e., respondents who have AI products in production), we can only assume that they’ve built their own tools and pipelines for deployment and monitoring. Given the many forms that an AI project can take, and that AI deployment is still something of a dark art, it isn’t surprising that AI developers and operations teams are only starting to adopt third-party tools for deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13733\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0111-1048x684.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 11. Automated tools used in mature practices for deployment<br /> and monitoring</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Versioning</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Source control has long been a standard practice in software development. There are many well-known tools used to build source code repositories.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’re confident that AI projects use source code repositories such as Git or GitHub; that’s a standard practice for all software developers. However, AI brings with it a different set of problems. In AI systems, the training data is as important as, if not more important than, the source code. So is the model built from the training data: the model reflects the training data and hyperparameters, in addition to the source code itself, and may be the result of hundreds of experiments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our survey shows that AI developers are only starting to use tools for data and model versioning. For data versioning, 35% of the respondents are using homegrown tools, while 46% responded “none of the above,” which we take to mean they’re using nothing more than a database. 9% are using <a href=\"https://dvc.org/\">DVC</a>, 8% are using tools from <a href=\"https://wandb.ai/site\">Weights &amp; Biases</a>, and 5% are using <a href=\"https://www.pachyderm.com/\">Pachyderm</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13734\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0112-1048x575.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 12. Automated tools used for data versioning</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools for model and experiment tracking were used more frequently, although the results are fundamentally the same. 29% are using homegrown tools, while 34% said “none of the above.” The leading tools were MLflow (27%) and Kubeflow (18%), with Weights &amp; Biases at 8%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13735\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/aadv_0113-1048x826.png\" /><figcaption>Figure 13. Automated tools used for model and experiment tracking</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Respondents who are considering or evaluating AI are even less likely to use data versioning tools: 59% said “none of the above,” while only 26% are using homegrown tools. Weights &amp; Biases was the most popular third-party solution (12%). When asked about model and experiment tracking, 44% said “none of the above,” while 21% are using homegrown tools. It’s interesting, though, that in this group, MLflow (25%) and Kubeflow (21%) ranked above homegrown tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although the tools available for versioning models and data are still rudimentary, it’s disturbing that so many practices, including those that have AI products in production, aren’t using them. You can’t reproduce results if you can’t reproduce the data and the models that generated the results. We’ve said that a quarter of respondents considered their AI practice mature—but it’s unclear what maturity means if it doesn’t include reproducibility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the past two years, the audience for AI has grown, but it hasn’t changed much: Roughly the same percentage of respondents consider themselves to be part of a “mature” practice; the same industries are represented, and at roughly the same levels; and the geographical distribution of our respondents has changed little.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We don’t know whether to be gratified or discouraged that only 50% of the respondents listed privacy or ethics as a risk they were concerned about. Without data from prior years, it’s hard to tell whether this is an improvement or a step backward. But it’s difficult to believe that there are so many AI applications for which privacy, ethics, and security aren’t significant risks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tool usage didn’t present any big surprises: the field is dominated by scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, though there’s a healthy ecosystem of open source, commercially licensed, and cloud native tools. AutoML has yet to make big inroads, but respondents representing less mature practices seem to be leaning toward automated tools and are less likely to use scikit-learn.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The number of respondents who aren’t addressing data or model versioning was an unwelcome surprise. These practices should be foundational: central to developing AI products that have verifiable, repeatable results. While we acknowledge that versioning tools appropriate to AI applications are still in their early stages, the number of participants who checked “none of the above” was revealing—particularly since “the above” included homegrown tools. You can’t have reproducible results if you don’t have reproducible data and models. Period.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the past year, AI in the enterprise has grown; the sheer number of respondents will tell you that. But has it matured? Many new teams are entering the field, while the percentage of respondents who have deployed applications has remained roughly constant. In many respects, this indicates success: 25% of a bigger number is more than 25% of a smaller number. But is application deployment the right metric for maturity? Enterprise AI won’t really have matured until development and operations groups can engage in practices like continuous deployment, until results are repeatable (at least in a statistical sense), and until ethics, safety, privacy, and security are primary rather than secondary concerns. Mature AI? Yes, enterprise AI has been maturing. But it’s time to set the bar for maturity higher.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Zpd80eXo270\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

At this point, NFTs exist on the Ethereum blockchain, but there’s no reason that they couldn’t be implemented on others; it seems reasonably likely that specialized blockchains will be built for NFTs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What kinds of value do NFTs create?&nbsp; It’s certainly been claimed that they create a market for digital art, that digital artists can now get “paid” for their work.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token\">Wikipedia</a> points to a number of other possible uses: they could also be used to represent other collectible objects (a digital equivalent to baseball trading cards), or to represent assets in online games, or even to represent shares in a real-world athlete’s <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/spencer-dinwiddie-brooklyn-nets-to-convert-contract-to-digital-token-2019-9-1028523488\">contract</a>–or a share in an athlete’s <a href=\"https://zephyrnet.com/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft/\">body</a>. Of course, there’s a secondary market in trading NFTs, just as a collector might sell a work of art from a collection.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All of these transactions rely on the idea that an NFT establishes &#8220;provenance&#8221; for a digital object. Who owns it? Who previously owned it? Who created it? Which of the many, many copies is the &#8220;original&#8221;? These are important questions for many valuable and unique physical objects: works of art, historical documents, antiques, and even real estate. NFTs present the possibility of bringing “ownership” to the virtual world: Who owns a tweet?&nbsp; Who owns a jpeg, gif, or png file?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Regardless of whether you think ownership for virtual objects is important, keep in mind that digital objects are close to meaningless if they aren&#8217;t copied. If you can&#8217;t see a png or jpg in your browser, it might as well be hanging on the wall in a museum.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s worth talking about, because the language of &#8220;provenance&#8221; comes directly from the museum world. If I have a painting—say, a Rembrandt—its provenance is the history of its ownership, ideally tracing it back to its original source.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>An artwork’s provenance serves two purposes: academic and commercial. Provenance is important academically because it allows you to believe you’re studying the right thing: a real Rembrandt, not a copy (copying famous paintings is a time-honored part of a painter&#8217;s training, in addition to an opportunity for forgery), or something that happens to look like Rembrandt, but isn’t (&#8220;hey, dark, depressing paintings of Dutch people are sort of cool; maybe I can do one&#8221;).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Commercially, provenance allows artworks to become extremely expensive. It allows them to become fetishized objects of immense value, at least to collectors. Particularly to collectors: &#8220;Hey, my Rembrandt, is worth more than your Vermeer.&#8221; It&#8217;s a lot harder to bid a painting&#8217;s price up into the millions if you are unsure about its provenance.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>NFTs enable the commercial function of provenance; they allow <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter\">@jack&#8217;s first tweet</a> to become a fetishized object that&#8217;s worth millions, at least until people decide that there&#8217;s something else they&#8217;d rather pay for. They establish a playground for the ultra-wealthy; if you have so much money that you don&#8217;t care how you spend it, why not buy Jack&#8217;s first tweet? You don&#8217;t even have to stick it on the wall and look at those old Dutch guys, or worry about burglar alarms. (You do have a good password, don&#8217;t you?)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s worth very much. What about the academic function? There&#8217;s some value in studying the early history of Twitter, possibly including @jack&#8217;s first tweet. But what exactly is the NFT showing me? That these are, indeed, Jack&#8217;s bits? Certainly not; who knows (and who cares) what became of the 0s and 1s that originally lived on Jack’s laptop and Twitter’s servers? Even if the original bits still existed, they wouldn&#8217;t be meaningful—lots of people have, or have had, the same set of bits on their computers.&nbsp; As any programmer knows, equality and identity aren’t the same.&nbsp; In this case, equality is important (is this what @jack wrote?); identity isn’t.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, an NFT doesn’t certify that the tweet is what @Jack actually said. An NFT is only about a bunch of bits, not about what the creator (or anyone else) asserts about the bits. @Jack could easily be mistaken, or dishonest (in literature, we deal all the time with authors who want to change what they have &#8220;said,&#8221; or what they meant by what they said). Our beliefs about the contents of @jack’s first tweet have everything to do with our beliefs about @jack and Twitter (where you can still <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/20\">find it</a>), and nothing to do with the NFT.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A tweet is one thing; what about a digital artwork? Does an NFT establish the provenance of a digital artwork? That depends on what is meant by &#8220;the provenance of a digital artwork.&#8221; A copy of a Rembrandt is still a copy, meaning it&#8217;s not the artifact that Rembrandt created. There are all sorts of techniques, ranging from very low to very high tech, to establish the link between artist and artwork. Those techniques are meaningless in the digital world, which eliminates noise, eliminates error in making copies. So, why would I care if my copy of the bits isn&#8217;t the artist&#8217;s original? The artist’s bits aren&#8217;t the &#8220;original,&#8221; either. That sort of originality is meaningless in the digital world: did the artist ever restore from backup? Was the artwork never swapped to disk, and swapped back in?\\xa0</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What &#8220;originality&#8221; really means is &#8220;this is the unique product of my mind.&#8221; We can ask any number of questions about what that might mean, but let&#8217;s keep it simple. Whatever that statement means, it&#8217;s not a statement on which an NFT or a blockchain has any bearing. We&#8217;ve already seen instances of people <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vxe7/people-are-stealing-art-and-turning-it-into-nfts\">creating NFTs for other people&#8217;s work</a>, and thus “owning” it.\\xa0 Is this theft of intellectual property, or a meta-art form of its own? (One of my favorite <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositions_1960\">avant-garde piano compositions</a> contains the instructions “The performer should prepare any composition and then perform it as well as he can.”)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So then, what kind of statement about the originality, uniqueness, or authorship of an artwork could be established by an NFT? Beeple, who sold an NFT titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for over $69 Million, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/digital-artist-beeple-common-misunderstanding-about-nfts.html\">says</a> that the NFT is not about ownership of the copyright: “You can display the token and show you own the token, but, you don’t own the copyright.” I presume Beeple still owns the copyright to his work–does that mean he can sell it again? The NFT doesn’t typically include the bits that make up the artwork (I think this is possible, but only for very small objects); as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122\">@jonty points out</a>, what the NFT actually contains isn’t the work, but a URL, a link.&nbsp; That URL points to a resource (a JSON metadata file or an IPFS hash) that’s most likely on a server operated by a startup. And that resource points to the work. If that link becomes invalid (for example, if the startup goes bust), then all you “own” is an invalid link. A 404.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some of these problems may be addressable; some aren’t.&nbsp; The bottom line, though, is that the link between a creator and a work of art can&#8217;t be established by cryptographic checksums.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So do NFTs create a market for artwork that didn’t exist before?\\xa0 Perhaps–though if what’s bought and sold isn’t the actual work (which remains infinitely and perfectly reproducible), or even the right to reproduce the work (copyright), it’s not clear to me how this really benefits artists, or even how it changes the picture much.\\xa0 I suppose this is a sort of 21st century patronage, in which someone rich gives an artist a pile of money for being an artist (or gives Jack Dorsey money for being @jack). As patronage, it’s more like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Haydn\">Prince Esterhazy</a> than <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\">Patreon</a>. A few artists will make money, perhaps even more money than they would otherwise, because I see no reason you can’t sell the work itself in addition to the NFT. Or sell multiple NFTs referencing the same work. But most won’t. The irreducible problem of being an artist–whether that’s a musician, a painter, or a sculptor, whether the medium is digital or physical–is that there are more people who want the job than are people willing to pay.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the end, what do NFTs create? A kind of digital fetishism around possessing bits, but perhaps not much else. An NFT shows that you are able to spend money on something–without involving the “something” itself. As Beeple says, “you can display the token.” This is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspicuous_consumption\">conspicuous consumption</a> in perhaps its purest form. It’s like buying jewelry and framing the receipt. That an explosion in conspicuous consumption should arise at this point in history isn’t surprising. The tech community is awash in wealth: wealth from unicorn startups that will never make a cent of profit, wealth from cryptocurrencies that are very difficult to use to buy or sell anything. What’s the value of being rich if you can’t show it off? How do you show something off during a socially distanced pandemic? And if all you care about is showing off your wealth, the NFT is where the real value lies, not in the artwork. You can buy, sell, or trade them, just like baseball cards. Just don’t mistake an NFT for “ownership” in anything but the NFT itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/7/17947744/banksy-ballon-girl-artwork-self-destructed-sothbys\">Banksy’s self-destroying artwork</a> was much more to the point. Unlike Banksy’s many public murals, which anyone can enjoy for free, this painting shredded itself as soon as it was bought at auction. Buying it destroyed it.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Rjydi0W5YiY\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>It seems harder than ever to agree with others on basic facts, let alone to develop shared values and goals: we even claim to live in a post-truth era<sup>1</sup>. With anti-vaxxers, QAnon, Bernie Bros, flat earthers, the intellectual dark web, and disagreement worldwide as to the seriousness of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of masks, have we lost our shared reality? For every piece of information X somewhere, you can likely find “not X” elsewhere. There is a growing disbelief and distrust in basic science and government. All too often, conversations on social media descend rapidly to questions such as &#8220;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/januszczak/status/1285266873483919365\">What planet are you from?</a>&#8221; </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Reality Decentralized</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What has happened? Reality has once again become decentralized. Before the advent of broadcast media and mass culture, individuals&#8217; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model\">mental models</a> of the world were generated locally, along with their sense of reality and what they considered ground truth. With broadcast media and the culture industries came the ability to forge top-down, national identities that could be pushed into the living rooms of families at prime time, completing the project of the press and newspapers in nation-forming<sup>2</sup>. The creation of the TV dinner was perhaps one of the most effective tools in carving out a sense of shared reality at a national level (did the TV dinner mean fewer people said Grace?).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rise of the Internet, Search, social media, apps, and platforms has resulted in an information landscape that bypasses the centralized knowledge/reality-generation machine of broadcast media. It is, however, driven by the incentives (both visible and hidden) of significant power structures, such as Big Tech companies. With the degradation of top-down knowledge, we&#8217;ve seen the return of locally-generated shared realities, where local now refers to proximity in cyberspace. Content creators and content consumers are connected, share information, and develop mental models of the world, along with shared or distinct realities, based on the information they consume. They form communities and shared realities accordingly and all these interactions are mediated by the incentive systems of the platforms they connect on.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a result, the number of possible realities has proliferated and the ability to find people to share any given reality with has increased. This InfoLandscape we all increasingly occupy is both novel and shifting rapidly. In it, we are currently finding people we can share some semblance of ground truth with: we&#8217;re forming our own InfoTribes, and shared reality is splintering around the globe.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To understand this paradigm shift, we need to comprehend:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>the initial vision behind the internet and the InfoLandscapes that have emerged,</li><li>how we are forming InfoTribes and how reality is splintering, </li><li>that large-scale shared reality has merely occupied a blip in human history, ushered in by the advent of broadcast media, and</li><li>who we look to for information and knowledge in an InfoLandscape that we haven&#8217;t evolved to comprehend.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The InfoLandscapes</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts&#8230; A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters, and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.&#8221;</p><cite>— <em>Neuromancer, </em>William Gibson (1984)</cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are several ways to frame the origin story of the internet. One is how it gave rise to new forms of information flow: the vision of a novel space in which anybody could publish anything and everyone could find it. Much of the philosophy of early internet pioneers was couched in terms of the potential to &#8220;flatten organizations, globalize society, decentralize control, and help harmonize people&#8221; (<a href=\"https://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/Wired/WIRED3-02.html\">Nicholas Negraponte, MIT</a>)<sup>3</sup>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As John Perry Barlow (of Grateful Dead fame) wrote in <em>A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace </em>(1996):</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth. We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity. Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This may have been the world we wanted but not the one we got. We are veering closer to an online and app-mediated environment similar to Deleuze&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwir47Gz-LjuAhU0zTgGHff9CPkQFjAIegQIAxAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fstable%2F778828&amp;usg=AOvVaw0SN92kTpl6SwpB2o1OM11f\"><em>Societies of Control</em></a>, in which we are increasingly treated as our data and what Deleuze calls “dividuals”: collections of behavior and characteristics, associated with online interactions, passwords, spending, clicks, cursor movements, and personal algorithms, that can be passed into statistical and predictive models and guided and incentivized to behave and spend in particular ways. Put simply, we are reduced to the inputs of an algorithm. On top of this, pre-existing societal biases are being reinforced and promulgated at previously unheard of scales as <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/when-models-are-everywhere/\">we increasingly integrate machine learning models into our daily lives</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Prescient visions of society along these lines were provided by William Gibson and Neal Stephenson&#8217;s 1992 <em>Snow Crash</em>: societies increasingly interacting in virtual reality environments and computational spaces, in which the landscapes were defined by information flows<sup>4</sup>. Not only this, but both authors envisioned such spaces being turned into marketplaces and segmented and demarcated by large corporations, only a stone&#8217;s throw from where we find ourselves today. How did we get here?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13688\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/AdobeStock_168604806-1048x604.jpeg\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Information Creation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the early days of the internet, you needed to be a coder to create a website. The ability to publish material was relegated to the technical. It was only in walled gardens such as CompuServe and AOL or after the introduction of tools like Blogger that regular punters were able to create their own websites with relative ease. The participatory culture and user-generated content of Web 2.0 opened up the creative space, allowing anyone and everyone to create content, as well as respond to, rate, and review it. Over the last decade, two new dynamics have drastically increased the amount of information creation, and, therefore, the &#8220;raw material&#8221; with which the landscape can be molded:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Smartphones with high-resolution video cameras and</li><li>The transformation of the attention economy by &#8220;social media&#8221; platforms,  which incentivize individuals to digitize more of their experiences and broadcast as much as possible.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And it isn&#8217;t only the generation of novel content or the speed at which information travels. It is also the vast archives of human information and knowledge that are being unearthed, digitized, and made available online. This is the space of content creation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Information Retrieval</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The other necessary side of information flow is discoverability, how it is organized, and where it’s surfaced. When so much of the world’s information is available, what is the method for retrieval? Previously the realm of chat rooms and bulletin boards, this question eventually gave rise to the creation of search engines, social media platforms, streaming sites, apps, and platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Platforms that automate the organizing and surfacing of online content are necessary, given the amount of content currently out there and how much is being generated daily. And they also require interrogating, as we humans base our mental models of how the world works on the information we receive, as we do our senses of reality, the way we make decisions, and the communities we form. Platforms such as Facebook have erected walled gardens in our new InfoLandscape and locked many of us into them, as predicted by both Gibson and Stephenson. Do we want such corporatized and closed structures in our networked commons?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>InfoTribes, Shared Reality</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>A by-product of algorithmic polarization and fragmentation has been the formation of more groups that agree within their own groups and disagree far more between groups, not only on what they value but on ground truth, about reality.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Online spaces are novel forms of community: people who haven&#8217;t met and may never meet in real life interacting in cyberspace. As scholars such as danah boyd have <a href=\"https://www.danah.org/papers/TakenOutOfContext.html\">made clear</a>, &#8220;social network sites like MySpace and Facebook are <em>networked publics</em>, just like parks and other outdoor spaces can be understood as publics.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One key characteristic of any community is a sense of <em>shared reality</em>, something agreed upon. Communities are based around a sense of shared reality, shared values, and/or shared goals. Historically, communities have required geographical proximity to coalesce, whereas online communities have been able to form outside the constraints of <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meatspace\">meatspace</a>. Let’s not make the mistake of assuming online community formation doesn’t have constraints. The constraints are perhaps more hidden, but they exist: they’re both technological and the result of how the InfoLandscapes have been carved out by the platforms, along with their technological and economic incentives<sup>5</sup>. Landscapes and communities have co-evolved, although, for most of history, on different timescales: mountain ranges can separate parts of a community and, conversely, we build tunnels through mountains; rivers connect communities, cities, and commerce, and humans alter the nature of rivers (an extreme example being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_River#Reversing_the_flow\">the reversal of the Chicago River</a>!).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The past two decades have seen the formation of several new, rapidly and constantly shifting landscapes that we all increasingly interact with, along with the formation of new information communities, driven and consolidated by the emergent phenomena of filter bubbles and echo chambers, among many others, themselves driven by the platforms’ drive for engagement. What the constituents of each of these communities share are mental models of how the world works, senses of reality, that are, for the most part, reinforced by the algorithms that surface content, either by 1) showing content you agree with to promote engagement or 2) showing content you totally disagree with to the same end. Just as the newspaper page has historically been a mish-mash collection of movie ads, obituaries, and opinions stitched together in a way that made the most business and economic sense for any given publisher, your Facebook feed is driven by a collection of algorithms that, in the end, are optimizing for growth and revenue<sup>6</sup>. These incentives define the InfoLandscape and determine the constraints under which communities form. It just so happens that dividing people increases engagement and makes economic sense. As Karen Hao <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/\">wrote recently</a> in the MIT Technology Review, framing it as a result of &#8220;Zuckerberg’s relentless desire for growth,&#8221; which is directly correlated with economic incentives:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The algorithms that underpin Facebook’s business weren’t created to filter out what was false or inflammatory; they were designed to make people share and engage with as much content as possible by showing them things they were most likely to be outraged or titillated by.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The consequence? As groups of people turn inward, agreeing more amongst their in-group, and disagreeing more fervently with those outside of it, the common ground in between, the shared reality, which is where perhaps the truth lies, is slowly lost. Put another way, a by-product of algorithmic polarization and fragmentation has been the formation of more groups that agree within their own groups and disagree far more with other groups, not only on what they value but on ground truth, about reality. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve witnessed the genesis of information tribes or <em>InfoTribes</em> and, as these new ideological territories are carved up, those who occupy InfoLandscapes hold that ground as a part of an InfoTribe<sup>7</sup>. Viewed in this way, the online flame wars we’ve become all too accustomed to form part of the initial staking out of territory in these new InfoLandscapes. Anthropologists have long talked about tribes as being formed around symbols of group membership, symbols that unite a people, like totem animals, flags, or&#8230; online content.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13689\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/AdobeStock_123489033-1048x667.jpeg\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Reality Brokers, Reality Splintering</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>The platforms that “decide” what we see and when we see it are reality brokers in a serious sense: they guide how individuals construct their sense of the world, their own identities, what they consider ground truth, and the communities they become a part of.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Arguably, many people aren’t particularly interested in the ground truth per se, they’re interested in narratives that support their pre-existing mental models of the world, narratives that help them sleep at night. This is something that 45 brilliantly, and perhaps unwittingly, played into and made starkly apparent, by continually sowing seeds of confusion, gaslighting the global community, and questioning the reality of anything that didn’t serve his own purposes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This trend isn’t confined to the US. The rise of populism more generally in the West can be seen as the result of diverging senses of reality, the first slice splitting people across ideological and party lines. Why are these divergences in a sense of shared reality becoming so exacerbated and apparent now? The unparalleled velocity at which we receive information is one reason, particularly as we likely haven’t evolved to even begin to process the vast amounts we consume. But it isn&#8217;t only the speed and amount, it&#8217;s the structure. The current media landscape is highly non-linear, as opposed to print and television. Our sense-making and reality-forming faculties are overwhelmed daily by the fractal-like nature of (social) media platforms and environments that are full of overlapping phenomena and patterns that occur at many different frequencies<sup>8</sup>. Moreover, the information we’re served is generally driven by opaque and obscure economic incentives of platforms, which are protected by even more obscure legislation in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation\">Section</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501714414/oreillycom-20\">230</a> in the US (there are other incentives at play, themselves rarely surfaced, in the name of “trade secrets”). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But let&#8217;s be careful here: it isn’t tech all the way down. We’re also deep in a several decades-long erosion of institutional knowledge, a mistrust in both science and government being the two most obvious. Neoliberalism has carved out the middle class while the fruits of top-down knowledge have left so many people unserved and behind. On top of this, ignorance has been actively cultivated and produced. Look no further than the recent manufacturing of ignorance from the top down with the goals of chaos creation, sowing the seeds of doubt, and delegitimizing the scientific method and data reporting (the study of culturally induced ignorance is known as <em>agnotology </em>and Proctor and Scheibinger&#8217;s book <a href=\"https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=11232\"><em>Agnotology: The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance</em></a> is canonical). On top of this, we&#8217;ve seen the impact of bad actors and foreign influence (not mutually exclusive) on the dismantling of shared reality, such as Russian interference around the 2016 US election.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This has left reality up for grabs and, in an InfoLandscape exacerbated by a global pandemic, those who control and guide the flow of information also control the building of InfoTribes, along with their shared realities. Viewed from another perspective, the internet is a space in which information is created and consumed, a many-sided marketplace of supply-and-demand in which the dominant currency is information, albeit driven by a shadow market of data, marketing collateral, clicks, cash, and crypto. The platforms that “decide” what we see and when we see it are <em>reality brokers </em>in a serious sense: they guide how individuals construct their sense of the world, their own identities, what they consider ground truth, and the communities they become a part of. In some cases, these reality brokers may be doing it completely by accident. They don&#8217;t necessarily care about the ground truth, just about engagement, attention, and profit: the breakdown of shared reality as collateral damage of a globalized, industrial-scale incentive system. In this framework, the rise of conspiracy theories is an artefact of this process: the reality brokered and formed, whether it be a flat earth or a cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles plotting against 45, is a direct result of the bottom-up sense-making of top-down <em>reality splintering</em>, the dissolution of ground truth and the implosion of a more general shared reality. Web 2.0 has had a serious part to play in this reality splintering but the current retreat away into higher signal and private platforms such as newsletters, Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, and Signal groups could be more harmful, in many ways.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shared reality is breaking down. But was it even real in the first place?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Shared Reality as Historical Quirk</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Being born after World War Two could lead one to believe that shared reality is foundational for the functioning of the world and that it’s something that always existed. But there’s an argument that shared reality, on national levels, was really ushered in by the advent of broadcast media, first the radio, which was in over 50% of US households by the mid-1930s, and then the television, nuclear suburban families, and TV dinners. The hegemonic consolidation of the American dream was directly related to the projection of ABC, CBS, and NBC into each and every household.  When cable opened up TV to more than three major networks, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2005.tb02677.x\">we began to witness the fragmentation and polarization of broadcast media into more camps</a>, including those split along party lines, modern exemplars being Fox News and CNN.  It is key to recognize that there were distinct and differing realities in this period, split along national lines (USA and Soviet Russia), ideological lines (pro- and anti-Vietnam), and scientific lines (the impact of smoking and asbestos). Even then, it was a large number of people with a small number of shared realities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The spread of national identity via broadcast media didn&#8217;t come out of the blue. It was a natural continuation of similar impacts of &#8220;The Printed Word,&#8221; which Marshall McLuhan refers to as an &#8220;Architect of Nationalism&#8221; in <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/understanding-media\"><em>Understanding Media</em></a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Socially, the typographic extension of man brought in nationalism, industrialism, mass markets, and universal literacy and education. For print presented an image of repeatable precision that inspired totally new forms of extending social energies.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Note that the shared realities generated in the US in the 20th century weren&#8217;t only done so by national and governmental interests, but also by commercial and corporate interests: mass culture, the culture industries, culture at scale as a function of the rise of the corporation. There were strong incentives for commercial interests to create shared realities at scale across the nation because it&#8217;s easier to market and sell consumer goods, for example, to a homogeneous mass: one size fits all, one shape fits all. This was achieved through the convergence of mass media, modern marketing, and PR tactics.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Look no further than Edward Bernays, a double nephew of Freud who was referred to in his obituary as &#8220;the Father of Public Relations.&#8221; Bernays famously &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612464\">used his Uncle Sigmund Freud&#8217;s ideas to help convince the public, among other things, that bacon and eggs was the true all-American breakfast</a>.&#8221; In the abstract of his 1928 paper &#8220;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170407053758/http://w.truty.org/PDFs/Media/BERNAYS-ManipulatingPublicOpinion.pdf\">Manipulating Public Opinion: The Why and the How</a>,&#8221; Bernays wrote:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If the general principles of swaying public opinion are understood, a technique can be developed which, with the correct appraisal of the specific problem and the specific audience, can and has been used effectively in such widely different situations as changing the attitudes of whites toward Negroes in America, changing the buying habits of American women from felt hats to velvet, silk, and straw hats, changing the impression which the American electorate has of its President, introducing new musical instruments, and a variety of others.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Century of Marketing began, in some ways, with psychoanalytical tools, marketing as a mode of reality generation, societal homogenization, and behavioral modification. A paradigm of this is how <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/how-an-ad-campaign-invented-the-diamond-engagement-ring/385376/\">DeBeers convinced the West to adopt diamonds as the necessary gem for engagement rings</a>. A horrifying and still relevant example is <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain\">Purdue Pharma and the Sackler dynasty&#8217;s marketing of OxyContin</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The channels used by marketers were all of the culture industries, including broadcast media, a theme most evident in the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School\">the Frankfurt School</a>, notably in that of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer. Look no further than Adorno&#8217;s 1954 essay &#8220;<a href=\"https://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/I%27mnotcrazy!/AdornoHowtoLookatTelevision.pdf\">How to Look at Television</a>&#8220;:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The old cultured elite does not exist any more; the modern intelligentsia only partially corresponds to it. At the same time, huge strata of the population formerly unacquainted with art have become cultural &#8220;consumers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although it was all the culture industries of the 20th century that worked to homogenize society at the behest of corporate interests, television was the one that we brought into our living rooms and that we eventually watched with family over dinner. Top-down reality-generation was centralized and projected into nuclear suburban homes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fast forward to today, the post-broadcast era, in which information travels close to the speed of light, in the form of lasers along fiber-optic cables and it’s both multi-platformed and personalized and everyone is a potential creator: reality, <em>once again</em>, is decentralized. In this frame, the age of shared reality was the anomaly, the exception rather than the rule. It’s perhaps ironic that one of the final throes of the age of shared reality was the advent of reality TV, a hyper-simulation of reality filtered through broadcast media. So now, in a fractured and fractal InfoLandscape, who do we look to in our efforts to establish some semblance of ground truth?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13690\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/AdobeStock_84736851-1048x704.jpeg\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Verified Checkmarks and Village Elders</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>If our online communities are our InfoTribes, then the people we look to for ground truth are our village elders, those who tell stories around the campfire. </em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When COVID-19 hit, we were all scrambling around for information about reality in order to make decisions, and not only were the stakes a matter of life and death but, for every piece of information somewhere, you could find the opposite somewhere else. The majority of information, for many, came through social media feeds. Even when the source was broadcast media, a lot of the time it would be surfaced in a social media feed. Who did I pay attention to? Who did I believe? How about you? For better or for worse, I looked to my local (in an online sense) community, those whom I considered closest to me in terms of shared values and shared reality. On top of this, I looked to those respected in my communities. On Twitter, for example, I paid attention to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EpiEllie\">Dr Eleanor Murray</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NAChristakis\">Professor Nicholas Christakis</a>, among many others. And why? They’re both leaders in their fields with track records of deep expertise, for one. But they also have a lot of Twitter followers and have the coveted blue verified checkmarks: in an InfoLandscape of such increasing velocity, we use rules of thumbs and heuristics around what to believe and what to not, including the validity and verifiability of the content creator, signaled by the number of followers, who the followers are (do I follow any of them? And what do I think of them?), and whether or not the platform has verified them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If our online communities are our InfoTribes, then the people we look to for ground truth are our village elders, those who tell stories around the campfire. In the way they have insight into the nature of reality, we look to them as our illiterate ancestors looked to those who could read or as Pre-Reformation Christians looked to the Priests who could read Biblical Latin. With the emergence of these decentralized and fractured realities, we are seeing hand-in-hand those who rise up to define the realities of each InfoTribe. It’s no wonder the term <em>Thought Leader</em> rose to prominence as this landscape clarified itself. We are also arguably in the midst of a paradigm shift from content being the main object of verification online to content creators themselves being those verified. As Robyn Caplan points out astutely in <em><a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/pornhub-verified-users-twitter.html\">Pornhub Is Just the Latest Example of the Move Toward a Verified Internet</a></em>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is often said that pornography drives innovation in technology, so perhaps that’s why many outlets have framed Pornhub’s verification move as “unprecedented.” However, what is happening on Pornhub is part of a broader shift online: Many, even most, platforms are using “verification” as a way to distinguish between sources, often framing these efforts within concerns about safety or trustworthiness.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But mainstream journalists are more likely to be verified than independent journalists, men more likely than women, and, as Caplan points out “there is a dearth of publicly available information about the demographics of verification in general—for instance, whether BIPOC users are verified at the same rates as white users.” And it is key to note that many platforms are increasingly verifying and surfacing content created by “platform partners,“ an approach also driven by business incentives. Who decides who we listen to? And, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/04/shoshana-zuboff-surveillance-capitalism-assault-human-automomy-digital-privacy\">Shoshana Zuboff</a> continually asks, <em>Who decides who decides?</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This isn&#8217;t likely to get better anytime soon, with the retreat to private and higher signal communication channels, the next generation of personalized products, the advent of deep fakes, the increasing amount of information we&#8217;ll be getting from voice assistants over the coming 5-10 years, the proportion of information consumed via ephemeral voice-only apps such as Clubhouse, and the possibility of augmented reality playing an increasing role in our daily lives.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what to do? Perhaps instead of trying to convince people of what we believe to be true, we need to stop asking &#8220;What planet are you from?&#8221; and start looking for shared foundations in our conversations, a sense of shared reality. We also have a public awareness crisis on our hands as the old methods of media literacy and education have stopped working. We need to construct new methods for people to build awareness, educate, and create the ability to dissent. Public education will need to bring to light the true contours of the emergent InfoLandscapes, some key aspects of which I have attempted to highlight in this essay. It will also likely include developing awareness of all our information platforms as multi-sided marketplaces, a growing compendium of all the informational dark patterns at play, the development of informational diets and new ways to count InfoCalories, and bringing antitrust suits against the largest reality brokers. Watch these spaces.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Many thanks to Angela Bowne, Anthony Gee, Katharine Jarmul, Jamie Joyce, Mike Loukides, Emanuel Moss, and Peter Wang for their valuable and critical feedback on drafts of this essay along the way.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Footnotes</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1. A term first coined in 1990 by the playwright Steve Teisch and that was the Oxford Dictionaries 2016 Word of the Year (source: <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/post-truth-and-its-consequences-what-a-25-year-old-essay-tells-us-about-the-current-moment\">Post-Truth and Its Consequences: What a 25-Year-Old Essay Tells Us About the Current Moment)</a><br />2. See Benedict Anderson&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/2259-imagined-communities\"><em>Imagined Communities</em></a> for more about the making of nations through shared reading of print media and newspapers.<br />3. I discovered this reference in Fred Turner&#8217;s startling book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo3773600.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><em>From Counterculture to Cyberculture</em></a>, which traces the countercultural roots of the internet to movements such as the New Communalists, leading many tech pioneers to have a vision of the web as &#8220;a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals&#8221; and &#8220;reimagined computers as tools for personal [and societal] liberation.&#8221;<br />4. There is a growing movement recognizing the importance of information flows in society. See, for example, <a href=\"https://courses.openmined.org/\">OpenMined&#8217;s free online courses</a> which are framed around the theme that <a href=\"https://blog.openmined.org/society-runs-on-information-flows/\">&#8220;Society runs on information flows.&#8221;</a><br />5. Think Twitter, for example, which builds communities by surfacing specific tweets for specific groups of people, a surfacing that’s driven by economic incentives, among others; although do note that TweetDeck, owned by Twitter, does not show ads, surface tweets, or recommend follows: perhaps the demographic that mostly uses TweetDeck doesn&#8217;t click on ads?<br />6. Having said this, there are some ethical constraints in the physical publishing business, for example, you can&#8217;t run an ad for a product across from an article or review of the product; there are also forms of transparency and accountability in physical publishing: we can all see what any given broadsheet publishes, discuss it, and interrogate it collectively.<br />7. Related concepts are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe_(internet)\">digital tribe</a>, a group of people who share common interests online, and the <a href=\"https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb\">memetic tribe</a>, &#8220;a group of agents with a meme complex, or memeplex, that directly or indirectly seeks to impose its distinct map of reality—along with its moral imperatives—on others.&#8221;<br />8. Is it a coincidence that we&#8217;re also currently seeing the rise of non-linear note-taking, knowledge base, and networked thought tools, such as <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a> and <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a>?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Ej4QyBpO27A\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

But other challenges to Silicon Valley’s preeminence are more fundamental than the tech diaspora.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Understanding four trends that may shape the future of Silicon Valley is also a road map to some of the biggest technology-enabled opportunities of the next decades:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Consumer internet entrepreneurs lack many of the skills needed for the life sciences revolution.</li><li>Internet regulation is upon us.</li><li>Climate response is capital intensive, and inherently local.</li><li>The end of the betting economy.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Inventing the future</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/09/27/invent-the-future/\">Alan Kay once said</a>. 2020 proved him both right and wrong. The coronavirus pandemic, or something worse, had long been predicted,&nbsp;but it still caught the world unprepared, a better future not yet invented. Climate change too has been on the radar, not just for decades but for over a century, since <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf\">Arrhenius’s 1896 paper on the greenhouse effect</a>. And it has long been known that inequality and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson/dp/0593230256/\">caste</a> are corrosive to social stability and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail\">predict the fate of nations</a>. Yet again and again the crisis finds us unprepared when it comes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In each case, though, the long-predicted future is still not foreordained. <em>It is up to us whether we are steamrollered by events beyond our control or whether we have the collective power to invent a better future.</em> Awakening may have come later than we might have wished, but crises like the pandemic and climate change can still be massive drivers of innovation. If entrepreneurs, investors, and governments step up to solve the hard problems that we face today, the future remains bright. But one thing is certain: the inventions we most urgently need will take us in a very different direction than the consumer internet and social media revolution that is coming to an unsightly end.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The coronavirus is a case in point. The explosion of biomedical invention that it has accelerated may well have impacts that extend well beyond the pandemic itself. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243\">mRNA vaccines</a> have given us a promising path to COVID immunity, developed in record time. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html\">Moderna’s vaccine was created within only two days</a> after Chinese scientist Yong-Zhen Zhang released the genetic sequence of the virus! And mRNA vaccines are also easily tweaked, raising the possibility of even quicker response to mutations, and even the creation of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243\">a framework for rapid development of many more vaccines.</a> We are starting to see the payoff of radically new approaches to biomedical innovation, and in particular, the way that machine learning is turbocharging research. During 2020, <a href=\"https://www.stateof.ai/\">more than 21,000 biomedical research papers made reference to AI and machine learning</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13666\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Tim_article-1048x591.png\" width=\"580\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recent announcement by DeepMind that its AlphaFold technology is able to <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology\">predict protein structure with accuracy comparable to slow and costly experimental methods</a> is a harbinger of breakthroughs to come. As geneticist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timjph/status/1333438139529048067\">Tim Hubbard wrote</a>, “The genomes we believed were blueprints for life were effectively encrypted—this will unlock them and transform biological and biomedical research.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: The nexus of machine learning and medicine, biology, and materials science will be to the coming decades what Silicon Valley has been to the late 20th and early 21st century.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why might this mark the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? First, the required skills are different. Yes, machine learning, statistical analysis, and programming are all needed, but so is deep knowledge of relevant science. The hubs where that knowledge can be found are not the special province of Silicon Valley, suggesting that other regions may take the lead. Second, many of the markets where fortunes will be made are regulated; navigating regulated markets also takes skills that are conspicuously missing in Silicon Valley. Finally, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos\">Theranos</a> demonstrated so vividly, it is harder to sustain a hype balloon in a scientific enterprise than in many of the markets where Silicon Valley has prospered. Many Silicon Valley investors have been lucky rather than smart. They may not do so well in a world where capital must be directed toward solving hard problems rather than toward winning a popularity contest.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Mastering “the demons of our own design”</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The opportunity of machine learning in scientific R&amp;D is profound. But machine learning also challenges our current approach to science, which relies on human theorizing and experiments. A machine learning model may be able to make successful predictions but not to explain them. When Arthur C. Clarke wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws\">“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,”</a> was he imagining a future in which our own science would leave our understanding behind? As <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/\">Judea Pearl has noted</a>, excessive identification of correlations (i.e, &#8220;curve fitting&#8221;) makes the definition of authentic causal relationships more challenging. And &#8220;real science&#8221; needs causal relationships.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I suspect that we will come to terms with machine learning-enabled science, just as we’ve come to terms with instruments that let us see far beyond the capabilities of the naked eye. But without a better understanding of our machine helpers, we may set them down paths that take us to the edge of a cliff, much as we’ve done with social media and our fractured information landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That fractured landscape is not what was predicted—internet pioneers expected freedom and the wisdom of crowds, not that we would all be under the thumb of giant corporations profiting from a market in disinformation. What we invented was not what we hoped for. The internet became the stuff of our nightmares rather than of our dreams. We can still recover, but at least so far, Silicon Valley appears to be part of the problem more than it is part of the solution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Can technology platforms rein in the demons of our own design (to use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Our-Own-Design-Innovation/dp/0470393750\">Richard Bookstaber’s memorable phrase</a>)? That too will be one of the challenges that shape the coming decades.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Government regulators in Europe and the US have set their sights on Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, but the regulatory responses will be insufficient if they are based on old theories, old understandings that the platforms have already outstripped. The US theory of antitrust has largely been based on the question of consumer harm, which is difficult to prove in marketplaces where services are provided to consumers at zero cost and where the marginal cost of experimenting on those consumers is also close to zero. The emerging European regulatory effort is properly focused on the role of dominant tech firms as “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en\">gatekeepers</a>.” It aims to systematically limit their ability to shape the market for their own advantage. Its remedies, though, are blunt, and the processes for assessing harms will most likely proceed more slowly than the harms themselves.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Markets are ecosystems, and like other ecosystems, there are hidden dependencies everywhere. The harm of Google abusing its monopoly position will not show up first in harm to consumers, but in depressed profits, decreased R&amp;D investment, and lower wages at the web companies to whom Google once directed traffic. For Amazon, it will show up in the increased fees and advertising costs required to show up in product search.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These harms to the supply side of marketplace platforms, with the majority of the gains being captured by the winner of <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">the winner-takes-all model that Silicon Valley has encouraged</a>, do eventually cascade to consumers. But because the pain is widely distributed and because the platforms are not required to report the information that would make it visible, the problem will not be obvious until much of the damage is irreversible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the “<a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/12979\">superstar firms</a>” ruthlessly compete with smaller firms that come up with fresh ideas, not only starving them of talent but often introducing copycat products and services, there is decreased innovation from the market as a whole. Cities are dominated by a new class of highly paid big-company employees driving up housing costs and forcing out lower wage workers; wages and working conditions of workers in less profitable industries are squeezed to drive the growth of the giants. Their very jobs are made contingent and disposable, with inequality baked in from the beginning of their employment. Governments are starved of revenue by giant companies that have mastered the art of tax avoidance. The list is far longer than that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the case of social media platforms, manipulation of users for profit has frayed the fabric of democracy and the respect for truth. Silicon Valley, which once harnessed the collective intelligence of its users, now uses its deep knowledge of its users to “trade against them.” (<a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/12/trading-for-their-own-account.html\">I predicted the broad outline of this turn back in 2007</a>, after conversations with venture capitalist and economist Bill Janeway <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/release2-issue2.pdf\">about what we might learn from Wall Street about the future of the internet</a>.) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology is far from the only offender. It is merely the most visible mirror of our values as a society. The extractive behavior the tech giants exhibit has been the norm for modern capitalism since Milton Friedman set its objective function in 1970: “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html\">The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits</a>.” This is all the sadder, though, since the tech industry set out to model something better. The generosity of open source software and the World Wide Web, the genius of algorithmically amplified collective intelligence are still there, pointing the way to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics/next-economy/\">the Next Economy</a>, but it is an economy we must actively choose, rather than riding the rails of a system that is taking us in the wrong direction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: Because platform businesses have failed to regulate themselves, they will have limits placed on their potential for good as well as harm.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s a sad time for Silicon Valley, because we are seeing not only the death of its youthful idealism but a missed opportunity. <a href=\"https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/paul-cohen\">Paul Cohen</a>, the former DARPA program manager for AI, made a powerful statement a few years ago at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences that we both attended: “The opportunity of AI is to help humans model and manage complex interacting systems.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That statement sums up so much of the potential that is squandered when firms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook fall prey to the Friedman doctrine rather than setting more ambitious goals for their algorithms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m not talking about future breakthroughs in AI so much as I’m talking about the fundamental advances in market coordination that the internet gatekeepers have demonstrated. These powers can be used to better model and manage complex interacting systems for the good of all. Too often, though, they have been made subservient to the old extractive paradigm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To explain what I mean requires a small aside.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Free market economists believe that the willingness of producers and consumers to agree on prices at which they will exchange goods or services (in idealized markets that are characterized by perfect competition with no asymmetries of power or information) leads to the best allocation of society’s resources. The solution to complex equations representing supply chains of self-interest is expressed in these market prices. Money, in effect, is the coordinating power behind Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like the anonymous internet wag <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/practice-and-theory/\">who wrote</a>, “The difference between theory and practice is always greater in practice than it is in theory,” economists recognize that perfect competition exists only in theory, that “externalities” exist where costs are borne by people other than the buyer and the seller, and that few markets are completely efficient. The role of the state, in many ways, is to address the shortcomings of the market. Diane Coyle’s book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179261/markets-state-and-people\"><em>Markets, State, and People</em></a> gives an excellent account of how economic policy makers think about the trade-offs they make when they intervene. Even at their best, though, the available interventions—taxes, monetary policy, and regulations—are piecemeal and take years or decades to agree on and implement. (<a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon\">Carbon pricing</a> is a case in point.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Google’s search engine has given us a convincing demonstration of a radically different method for managing an economic system. Constantly refined, dynamic, and infused with AI, Google’s algorithmic systems demonstrate that it is possible to manage an economy in ways not imagined by 20th century economists. 40,000 times a second, 3.5 billion times a day, Google’s centrally managed search performs the magic that, for so long, was thought to be the unique province of decentralized, self-interested actors transacting in priced markets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a brilliant stroke, Google built an algorithmic system that uses hundreds of distinct information signals to make the best match between tens of millions of information providers and billions of information consumers—<em>but price is not one of those signals</em>. That is not to say that Google does not participate in the money economy. Far from it. But&nbsp; for Google’s first decade and a half, the priced market of pay-per-click advertising was a sidecar to the primary matching marketplace of search. The initial genius of Google was to run the market coordinated by collective intelligence (organic search) and the market coordinated by money (pay per click advertising) in parallel. And when producers with economic motivations manipulated organic search results for profit but to the detriment of Google’s users, producing pages that satisfied the algorithms but failed to satisfy consumers, <a href=\"https://martinwilson.info/history-of-google-algorithm-updates-killed-businesses/\">Google was ruthless in updating the algorithms</a> to focus on consumer benefit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To be sure, a great deal of content on the World Wide Web and in social media is produced and consumed with commercial intent, but a remarkable amount is produced entirely without a profit motive. Google economists have told me that only six percent of Google search result pages carry any advertising at all. The other 94% of pages are the product of the joyful exuberance of humanity, creating and sharing for the joy of it. If there has ever been a harbinger of a possible economy of abundance, we can see it in the best of the internet sharing economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In recent years, though, Google has increasingly blurred the lines between the two information markets it manages (the price-free market of search and the priced market of advertising). <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/\">And that has made commercially valuable search results less effective than those that have no purely economic value.</a> That is, Google appears to match information producers and consumers<em> more effectively</em> in the absence of the distorting power of money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So too Amazon. Unlike Google, Amazon has always used price as an important signal in its search rankings, but price was intelligently combined with measures of collective opinion—what other consumers thought was the best product—to create a market that was more efficient than any previous consumer goods marketplace. But in recent years, with the introduction of search advertising as a major new revenue line, Amazon too has turned away from using the tools of collective intelligence to find the best products for its customers. Its search is now dominated by “featured” products—that is, products that producers have paid to put in front of consumers. With advertising now one of the biggest drivers of Amazon’s profits, it is hard to imagine that the company can remain, as Jeff Bezos has proudly boasted, the most consumer-centric platform on earth. I wrote about this problem at length last year, in “<a href=\"https://qz.com/1666863/why-big-tech-keeps-outsmarting-antitrust-regulators/\">Antitrust regulators are using the wrong tools to regulate big tech</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So many of the problems that antitrust actions and other regulations are now gearing up to address are, paradoxically, the result of the prime directive by which our economic and legal system governs its corporations: “Thou must maximize profits.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The notion of maximizing profit is so ingrained in our society that in 2014, when Facebook researchers published a paper called “<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788\">Experimental Evidence of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks</a>,” the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html\">response was swift and savage</a>. It was considered a terrible breach of research ethics to test whether the mix of stories in the Facebook news feed made its readers happier or sadder. The reaction was particularly striking because no one seemed to notice that Silicon Valley explicitly celebrates and teaches its entrepreneurs how to manipulate the emotional state of users, calling it “<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X/\">growth hacking</a>” or “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a>” or “<a href=\"http://amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/\">creating habit-forming products</a>.” No one complains about <em>these</em> experiments. It’s considered a best practice to experiment on your customers as long as it is in pursuit of growth and profits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Because the cost of those experiments is so low—it’s a sunk cost of the business—experimental mistakes and unforeseen consequences are only to be expected. They become a new class of externality little considered by economists and regulators.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In retrospect, some formal experimentation on emotional contagion and reflection on its implications would have been a good idea. Instead, we continue to run global-scale unsupervised experiments on the power of social media to spread negative emotional contagion for profit, while any effort by the platforms to influence their users in positive directions is still considered by many to be inappropriate intervention, or is abandoned because it might reduce user activity and growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, during the 2020 US presidential election, Facebook engineers reportedly trained a machine learning algorithm to recognize posts that their users would consider “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html\">bad for the world</a>,” but the company found that showing fewer of them reduced the number of user sessions and thus, presumably revenue and profits. So they retrained the algorithm to find the point where “bad for the world” posts were reduced but not by so much that they impacted user sessions. Other changes to optimize for “news ecosystem quality” were put in place for a few weeks leading up to the election, but reversed thereafter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Shareholder value” is so ingrained in corporate governance that a special class of corporation, “<a href=\"https://socialenterprise.us/resources/news/b-corps-public-benefit-corporations/\">the public benefit corporation</a>,” has been defined to protect companies that are managed to take other considerations than profit into account. All “normal” companies are expected to treat employees, the environment, and society as costs to be minimized, avoided, or eliminated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Silicon Valley is a mirror of what is wrong with our economy and corporate governance, not the cause of it, or even the worst exemplar.</em> (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490543/\">Tobacco</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/exxon-and-the-oil-industry-knew-about-climate-change/exxons-climate-denial-history-a-timeline/\">oil</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357445/\">pharma</a> companies vie for the top spot.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In many ways, regulators can still learn from Silicon Valley. Our economy too is shaped by invisible algorithms and embedded objectives. If regulators can see the analogies between the way Google, Amazon, and Facebook’s algorithms shape their services and the way that law, tax, and monetary policy shape who gets what and why in our society, and why corporate leaders act the way they do, we can use the current moment to improve not only Silicon Valley but the fairness and the goals of our entire economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As I wrote last year in “<a href=\"https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/we-have-already-let-the-genie-out-of-the-bottle/\">We Have Already Let the Genie Out of the Bottle</a>,” an essay for a Rockefeller Foundation workshop on regulating AI, our corporations and our government and our markets are what science fiction writer Charlie Stross calls “<a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2017/12/29/llcs-are-slow-ais.html\">slow AIs.</a>” I made the case that we cannot regulate them without rebuilding the rules by which they operate:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Attempts at governance…are futile until we recognize that we have built a machine and set it on its course. Instead, we pretend that the market is a natural phenomenon best left alone, and we fail to hold its mechanism designers to account. We need to tear down and rebuild that machine, reprogramming it so that human flourishing, not corporate profit, becomes its goal. We need to understand that we can’t just state our values. We must implement them in a way that our machines can understand and execute.”</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Silicon Valley can still lead in this effort. The big platforms must understand their social responsibility to <a href=\"https://www.petershallard.com/create-more-value-than-you-capture/#:~:text=Creating%20more%20value%20than%20you%20capture%20is%20a%20philosophy%20of,don\\'t%20show%20up).\">create more value than they capture</a>, focus their algorithmic systems on improving human welfare, find ways to measure and communicate the value that they create, and help our broader society to better “model and manage complex interacting systems.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The danger of regulatory response that simply tries to turn back the clock and doesn’t take into account the ways technology done right could point the way forward is illustrated by the battle over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_Proposition_22\">California’s Proposition 22</a>. Its passage overturned state regulations requiring gig economy companies to treat their workers as employees rather than independent contractors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional labor protections and benefits assumed a world in which individuals worked for a single employer. An attempt to impose those assumptions on companies reliant on gig workers was seen as an existential threat by those companies, who mounted a massive campaign against the new rules. Their customers agreed, and regulations were rolled back by the will of the public.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The gig economy companies have made some small steps toward flexible benefits on their own, but they are a pale shadow of what they might have been if the companies and their gig workers and their customers, not to mention their regulators, had been working together to build systems that would allow benefits to be managed as dynamically as employment. In the German model of stakeholder capitalism, workers are at the management table rather than pitted against the companies they work for. Is there a 21st century version of stakeholder capitalism yet to be designed, one that is not zero-sum but instead “models and manages complex interacting systems” to find better solutions for all?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As I argued five years ago in “<a href=\"https://wtfeconomy.com/workers-in-a-world-of-continuous-partial-employment-4d7b53f18f96\">Workers in a World of Continuous Partial Employment</a>,” we need a much more robust benefit system that is centered on the worker, not on the company. The gig economy companies are not outliers. Continuous partial employment has become the norm in much of the economy. A combination of the rise of the Friedman doctrine and the demise of labor unions has reset the balance of power between companies and their workers. The legislative and regulatory response needs to address this power imbalance systematically, across the entire labor economy, using the capabilities of technology to create new models of cooperation between companies and their workers, and a safety net that catches everyone, not just a lucky few.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Climate change and the energy economy</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recent news that Elon Musk is one of the world’s richest people is also a harbinger of the biggest opportunity of the 21st century: to avert climate change. Electric vehicles are the tip of the iceberg. Heating and cooling, agriculture, raw materials and manufacturing—all need reinvention. Climate will reshape residential and office construction, insurance, finance, and where and how food is produced. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html\">Massive climate migrations have only just begun</a>; tens or hundreds of millions of people will need to be resettled. Will we offer them shantytowns, or will we help them become settlers building a new, better world?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: There will be more climate billionaires created in the next two decades than in the internet boom.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the exception of Musk, many of the already-minted climate billionaires are outside the US, highlighting the way that other countries already have the lead in these industries of the future. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-green-billionaires/\">Bloomberg recently named a few</a>: China’s Zeng Yuqun, Huang Shilin, Pei Zhenhua, and Li Ping (electric vehicle batteries), Li Zhenguo, Li Chunan, and Li Xiyan (solar panels and films), Lin Jianhua (solar panels and films), and Wang Chuanfu (electric vehicles); Germany’s Aloys Wobben (wind turbines); and Spain’s Jose Manuel Entrecanales (renewable power generation).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are great fortunes yet to be made, of course. While <a href=\"https://www.impossiblefoods.com/\">Impossible Foods</a> CEO Patrick Brown and <a href=\"https://www.beyondmeat.com/\">Beyond Meat</a> founder Ethan Brown (no relation) and <a href=\"https://www.plenty.ag/about-us/\">Plenty</a>’s Matt Barnard, <a href=\"https://boweryfarming.com/\">Bowery</a>’s Irving Fain, or <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/nordic-harvest-hydroponic-farms/\">Nordic Harvest&#8217;s Anders Riemann</a> are not yet billionaires, it is quite possible that they will be. But for the most part, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors are not leaders in this sector.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In any case, who will get rich helping us transition to a new energy economy is unimportant compared to the question of whether we will summon the political will to make the transition in time to avoid the most disastrous consequences of climate change, which could, at their worst, bring an end to civilization as we know it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A strong argument can be made that only a crash mobilization of the economy to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything\">electrify everything</a> can get us there in time. Saul Griffith, Alex Laskey, and Sam Calisch of the nonprofit <a href=\"http://rewiringamerica.org/\">Rewiring America</a> have made just that argument. And here, the algorithms that guide our economy to focus on “efficiency” need to be questioned. As economist and former venture capitalist Bill Janeway said to me, mobilizations can get hung up and stalled out due to excessive concern with efficiency as the dominant metric of value.&nbsp; “World War II was won on ‘the&nbsp; momentum of production,’ “ he noted, quoting from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Struggle-Survival-Elliott-Janeway/dp/0911548521\"><em>The Struggle for Survival</em></a>, his father Eliot Janeway’s book about the World War II mobilization. “Similarly the WPA put millions to work during the Depression precisely because effective employment—not efficiency—was the dominant goal.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are five pillars to Rewiring America’s case for electrification as the answer to our urgent need to limit greenhouse gas emissions:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1. <strong>Electrifying everything requires only half as much energy as our current system.</strong> Saul and his team worked with the US Department of Energy in 2018 to create a<a href=\"http://departmentof.energy/\">n interactive map</a> of <a href=\"https://www.otherlab.com/blog-posts/us-energy-flow-super-sankey\">all the source-to-use energy flows in America</a>. This map of our energy economy was started under the Nixon administration, but its true implications are only now being realized. One of the surprising consequences of their analysis is that half the energy we use is spent collectively on things like mining and transporting fossil fuels, and in thermoelectric losses from converting them to electricity, to heat, or to movement. Direct electrification of as much of our economy as possible is not only achievable but also the fastest way to avert climate disaster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2. <strong>We need to reconceive solar panels, batteries, electric cars, and electric appliances as part of our national energy infrastructure</strong>, even when they are on or in people&#8217;s homes, rather than thinking of infrastructure as something owned only by utilities or the government. Electric heat pumps can be used for both hot water and home heating; hot water storage can in effect act as a battery, heating up with solar electricity during the day and giving heat back at night. We won&#8217;t balance a future renewables-heavy grid without using local (i.e., home and business) batteries and thermal loads (water and space heat) as part of the overall demand response and storage.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3. <strong>Markets won&#8217;t move fast enough without a World War II-style mobilization of private industry.</strong> We need a heroic 4–5 year effort to get to 100% transformation of our energy infrastructure. Otherwise, we will have to wait for the natural replacement rate on infrastructure, which will take decades that we don’t have. That heroic 4–5 year effort gets us to the scale of production appropriate to enable 100% adoption of the solution technologies, which will then require a consistent 10–20 year rollout beyond that initial ramp-up period.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4. <strong>Electrifying the US will create jobs—lots of them.</strong> Rewiring America estimates that such an effort could, at peak, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90533448/how-to-create-25-million-jobs-by-decarbonizing-the-economy\">create as many as 25 million US jobs</a>, and 5 million ongoing jobs in the new industries. The cost of the retrofit will be high, but so will the payoff, in both jobs and in savings to consumers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rooftop solar can produce at most 25% of the total needs of a fully electrified economy, so there&#8217;s still plenty of room and need for grid-scale solar—the electrified economy will require 3x the capacity of the current grid—but local is the cheapest energy and the best way to pass savings to the consumer, as well as to create highly localized jobs across the country.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rooftop solar jobs are of necessity geographically decentralized, potentially enabling an ecosystem of small local firms rather than rewarding a few giants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5. <strong>Who gets the financial benefit of this massive investment—utilities, solar installers, or consumers—depends on interest rates.</strong><br />&#8220;The miracle technology is much more likely to be finance than it is to be fusion,&#8221; Saul said in a recent presentation. Arguably, it was the invention of the auto loan by Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors and the later financial innovation by the Roosevelt administration of the Federal Housing Authority and the home mortgage that created the US middle class, he noted. &#8220;Mortgages are time machines that let you have the future you want today.&#8221; We need something similar for the electrification transformation. Otherwise, &#8220;only rich people can afford to decarbonize today.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Utilities already have access to low-cost loans. But consumers don&#8217;t, and if you want to create both jobs and cost savings for consumers, <a href=\"https://www.rewiringamerica.org/household-savings-report\">low-cost interest rates for home electrification are the best way to do it</a>. Otherwise, the savings all get captured by middlemen, or by utilities, and adoption is much slower.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This observation is entirely in line with my broader point that regulations and the tax code play much the same role in shaping who gets what and why in markets as do the controlling algorithms in online platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The end of casino capitalism?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The final, and perhaps most important, reason why Silicon Valley as we know it may be over is that its current incarnation is a product of the extraordinarily cheap capital of the years since the global financial crisis of 2009.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are two economies, often confused: the operating economy, in which companies make and sell products and services, and the betting economy, in which wealthy people bet on which companies will win and which will lose in the beauty contest that stock markets have become. In the operating economy, the measure of success is, as Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker memorably put it, “<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/long-term-capitalism/redefining-capitalism\">the solution to human problems</a>.” Companies compete to solve those problems more effectively and earn a profit thereby. Along the way, they employ people productively, create valuable new goods and services, and contribute to their communities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the betting economy, the measure of success is stock price, the higher the better. Fueled by massive money creation by central banks, capital is abundant (for those who, by virtue of existing wealth, already have access to it), and traditional sources of return, such as interest on loans or ROI on investment in plants and equipment or employees, are dwarfed by the potential returns that can be achieved by playing on the madness of crowds. What can you call it but a bubble when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/business/dealbook/roblox-tech-ipos.html\">the median valuation of this past year’s tech IPOs was 24 times trailing revenue</a>, while tech IPOs during most of the past decade were only valued at about six times trailing revenue. Data collected by University of Florida professor Jay Ritter shows that it’s even worse than it appears: <a href=\"https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf\">only 16% of 2020’s tech IPOs had any profits at all</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Capital markets do play an important role in our society. Bets on an unknown future are an important way to fund innovation and to build out infrastructure in advance of the prosperity that it will bring once that innovation has been widely deployed. But in today’s <a href=\"https://evonomics.com/financialization-hidden-illness-rana-foorohar/\">financialized economy</a>, the returns on betting for its own sake have grown far faster than the returns on true operating investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many who will argue that the enormous payoffs coming to today’s entrepreneurs and investors are the result of their world-changing innovations. History suggests otherwise. There was plenty of innovation when the returns to investors and entrepreneurs were a fraction of what they are today.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Silicon Valley is named for the semiconductor manufacturing companies that became the foundation of all that followed. Intel, one of the most successful of those companies, went public in 1971 with a valuation of about $58 million (<a href=\"https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1971?amount=58\">about $372 million in today’s dollars</a>). Intel had a small profit when it went public, but it went on to earn hundreds of billions of dollars in operating profit over the succeeding decades. Apple and Microsoft, the standard bearers of the next generation of Silicon Valley companies, were also profitable at IPO. Two decades later, Google too was highly profitable when it went public, and while Amazon was one of the first companies to legitimize the profitless IPO, <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/why-amazons-history-of-ipo-era-losses-means-little-for-todays-unprofitable-unicorns/\">its losses were falling as it grew</a>. All have turned into companies that generate enormous profits in the operating economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Few of the companies in the recent crop of Silicon Valley companies can make that claim. At its IPO early in 2020, Palantir had <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3562713/biggest-tech-ipos-2020.html\">prior year revenues of $743 million, on which it posted a loss of $576 million</a>. Uber went public in 2019 with <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519103850/d647752ds1.htm#rom647752_8a\">an operating loss of over $3 billion on $11 billion in revenue</a>. When DoorDash went public, it had <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9\">revenues of $1.92 billion for the trailing nine months, on which it had a net loss of $149 million</a>. All these companies have valuations in the tens of billions, making their founders and investors very rich, despite not making any money at all in the operating economy. In many cases, the money invested in these companies was used to create the illusion of growth, acquiring customers below the cost of delivering services to them. It is money invested in the promise of more money, a kind of Ponzi scheme decoupled from the operating economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Intel’s stock market investors were making a rational bet that a world-changing technology would earn a huge stream of future profits. Palantir’s, Uber’s, and DoorDash’s investors were betting on how other investors might value their stocks, much as 16th century Dutch investors bet on the “value” of unique tulips or mid-19th century British investors bet on the prospects for railroads in distant countries, many of which were never built. Some of these companies may eventually turn an operating profit, but it is likely that when they do, investors will realize that those profits don’t justify the sky-high valuations, which will then come back down to earth. As Benjamin Graham, the father of the style of value investing favored by Warren Buffett, is reported to have said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing machine.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, the founders of Intel, less motivated to build world-changing products because the proceeds were orders of magnitude less than they are for today’s Silicon Valley entrepreneurs? I suspect that it is the other way around. The easy profits from today’s financial betting markets encourage <a href=\"https://delong.typepad.com/baumol-1990-entrepreneurship.pdf\">unproductive innovation</a>. I’d take Gordon Moore over WeWork’s Adam Neumann any day. When investors and entrepreneurs who promise future innovation but are unable to deliver it still walk away with billions, something is seriously wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As John Maynard Keynes wrote in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money\"><em>General Theory</em></a> during the depths of the Great Depression, “Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem is that money “invested” in the betting economy is not really invested. It is spent, just like money at the gaming table. When the WeWork bubble popped, the money SoftBank had spent propping up its valuation might just as well have gone up in smoke. The end of this process could look something like the financial crisis of 2009. Money invested in the collateralized debt obligations of the first decade of this century was not backed by true worth in the operating economy, so when the CDOs went bust, the money simply vanished.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: When the bubble ends, greater opportunities will remain.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the gifts—if you can call it that—of crises like the pandemic and climate change is that they may teach us that we no longer have time for frivolity. We need our investment capital to flow back to the operating economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/welcome-to-the/9781492089247/\">a robust strategy</a> for investors and entrepreneurs: Work on stuff that matters. Invest in solving problems. Make a real difference in people’s lives. You will know you have done that when operating profits fairly earned, not stock market gains, are your measure of investment success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of the big areas of innovation that I highlight in this essay—life sciences and climate change—require large amounts of real investment capital. Unlike money invested in internet companies that used it to buy unprofitable growth, money invested in Tesla was used to build factories, to manufacture cars and electric batteries, and to roll out national charging networks.The path to high returns may take longer, but the need is real, and so is the value created.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Solving global crises requires the best of what we have to offer. If the best way to predict the future is to invent it, it’s time we got busy. Which world do we want to invent? It’s up to us.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/dHbA6ByfR5w\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

But these problems are squarely within the domain of traditional AI. Playing Chess and Go or building ever-better language models have been AI projects for decades. The following projects have a different flavor:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>In February, PLOS Genetics published an article by researchers who are using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009303\">create artificial human genomes</a>.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Another group of researchers published an article about using NLP (natural language processing) to analyze viral genomes and, specifically, to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/14/1016162/ai-language-nlp-coronavirus-hiv-flu-mutations-antinbodies-immune-vaccines/\">predict the behavior of mutations</a>. They were able to distinguish between errors in &#8220;syntax&#8221; (which make the gene non-viable), and changes in semantics (which result in a viable virus that functions differently).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Yet another group of researchers modelled a small portion of a fruit fly&#8217;s brain (the part used for smell), and were able to train that to <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/fruit-fly-brain-network-hacked-for-language-processing\">create a model for natural language processing</a>. This new model appears to be orders of magnitude more efficient than state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The common thread through these advances is applying work in one field to another area that’s apparently unrelated—not sustained research at cracking a core AI problem. Using NLP to analyze mutations? That&#8217;s brilliant—and it&#8217;s one of those brilliant things that sounds so obvious once you think about it. And it&#8217;s an area where NLP may have a real significant advantage because it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> actually understand language, any more than humans understand DNA.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The ability to create artificial human genomes is important in the short term because the human genome data available to researchers is limited by privacy laws. Synthetic genomes aren&#8217;t subject to privacy laws, because they don&#8217;t belong to any person. Data limitations aren’t a new problem; AI researchers frequently face the problem of finding sufficient data to train a model. So they have developed a lot of techniques for generating &#8220;synthetic&#8221; data: for example, cropping, rotating, or distorting pictures to get more data for image recognition. Once you’ve realized that it’s possible to create synthetic data, the jump to creating synthetic genomes isn’t far-fetched; you just have to make the connection. Asking where it might lead in the long term is even more important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to come up with more examples of surprising work that comes from bringing techniques from one field into another. <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\">DALL-E</a> (which combines NLP with image analysis to create a new image from a description) is another example. So is <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432202\">ShadowSense</a>, which uses image analysis to let robots determine when they are touched.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These results suggest that we&#8217;re at the start of something new. The world isn&#8217;t a better place because computers can play Go; but it may become a better place if we can understand how our genomes work. Using adversarial techniques outside of game play or NLP techniques outside of language will inevitably lead to solving the problems we <em>actually</em> need to solve. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s really only half the story. While we may be on the edge of making great advances in applications, we aren&#8217;t making the same advances in fairness and justice. Here are some key indicators:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Attempts to train models to predict the pain that Black patients will suffer as a result of medical procedures have largely failed. Recently, research discovered that the models were more successful if they got their training data by <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/22/1016577/ai-fairer-healthcare-patient-outcomes/\">actually listening to Black patients</a>, rather than just using records from their doctors.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>A study by MIT discovered that training predictive crime models on crime reports rather than arrests doesn&#8217;t make them less racist. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fortunately, the doctors modeling medical pain decided to listen to their Black patients; unfortunately, that kind of listening is still rare. Listening to Black patients shouldn&#8217;t be a breakthrough akin to using NLP to analyze DNA. Why weren’t we listening to the patients in the first place? And why are the patients’ assessments of their pain so different from the doctors’?&nbsp; This is clearly progress, but more than that, it’s a sign of how much progress has yet to be made in treating minorities fairly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And I&#8217;m afraid that MIT has only discovered that there aren&#8217;t any historical data sources about crime that aren&#8217;t biased, something we already knew. If you look at so-called &#8220;white collar&#8221; crime, Midtown Manhattan is the most dangerous neighborhood in New York. But that&#8217;s not where the police are spending their time.&nbsp; The only somewhat tongue-in-cheek <a href=\"https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/static/whitepaper.pdf\">paper</a> accompanying the map of <a href=\"https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/\">White Collar Crime Risk Zones</a> suggests that their next step will be using “facial features to quantify the ‘criminality’ of the individual.”&nbsp; That would clearly be a joke if such techniques weren’t already <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53165286\">under development</a>, and not just in China.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It looks like we&#8217;re at the cusp of some breakthroughs in AI—not new algorithms or approaches, but new ways to use the algorithms we already have. But the more things change, the more they stay the same. Our ability to think about our responsibilities of ethics and justice—and, more specifically, to put&nbsp; in place mechanisms to redress harms caused by unfair decisions–are slow to catch up.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/kzdPxx3DXng\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Some of these are emerging topics and others are developments on existing concepts, but all of them will inform our thinking in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>MLOps FTW</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MLOps attempts to bridge the gap between Machine Learning (ML) applications and the CI/CD pipelines that have become standard practice. ML presents a problem for CI/CD for several reasons. The data that powers ML applications is as important as code, making version control difficult; outputs are probabilistic rather than deterministic, making testing difficult; training a model is processor intensive and time consuming, making rapid build/deploy cycles difficult. None of these problems are unsolvable, but developing solutions will require substantial effort over the coming years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>The Time Is Now to Adopt Responsible Machine Learning</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The era in which tech companies had a regulatory “free ride” has come to an end. Data use is no longer a “wild west” in which anything goes; there are legal and reputational consequences for using data improperly.&nbsp; Responsible Machine Learning (ML) is a movement to make AI systems accountable for the results they produce.&nbsp; Responsible ML includes explainable AI (systems that can explain why a decision was made), human-centered machine learning, regulatory compliance, ethics, interpretability, fairness, and building secure AI. Until now, corporate adoption of responsible ML has been lukewarm and reactive at best. In the next year, increased regulation (such as GDPR, CCPA), antitrust, and other legal forces will force companies to adopt responsible ML practices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>The Right Solution for Your Data: Cloud Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data lakes have experienced a fairly robust resurgence over the last few years, specifically cloud data lakes. With more businesses migrating their data infrastructure to the cloud, as well as the increase of open source projects driving innovation in cloud data lakes, these will remain on the radar in 2021. Similarly, the data lakehouse, an architecture that features attributes of both the data lake and the data warehouse, gained traction in 2020 and will continue to grow in prominence in 2021. Cloud data warehouse engineering develops as a particular focus as database solutions move more and more to the cloud.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>A Wave of Cloud-Native, Distributed Data Frameworks</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data science grew up with Hadoop and its vast ecosystem.&nbsp; Hadoop is now last decade’s news, and momentum has shifted to Spark, which now dominates the way Hadoop used to. But there are new challengers out there. New distributed computing frameworks like Ray and Dask are more flexible, and are cloud-native: they make it very simple to move workloads to the cloud.&nbsp; Both are seeing strong growth. What’s the next platform on the horizon?&nbsp; We’ll see in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Natural Language Processing Advances Significantly</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year, the biggest story in AI was GPT-3, and its ability to generate almost human-sounding prose.&nbsp; What will that lead to in 2021? There are many possibilities, ranging from interactive assistants and automated customer service to automated fake news. Looking at GPT-3 more closely, here are the questions you should be asking. GPT-3 is being delivered via an API, not by incorporating the model directly into applications. Is “Language-as-a-service” the future? GPT-3 is great at creating English text, but has no concept of common sense or even facts; for example, it has recommended suicide as a cure for depression.&nbsp; Can more sophisticated language models overcome those limitations?&nbsp; GPT-3 reflects the biases and prejudices that are built into languages. How are those to be overcome, and is that the responsibility of the model or of the application developers?&nbsp; GPT-3 is the most exciting development to appear during the last year; in 2021, our attention will remain focused on it and its successors. We can’t help but be excited (and maybe a little scared) by GPT-4.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/teams.html\">O’Reilly’s online learning platform</a> can give your employees the resources they need to upskill and stay up to date on AI, data and hundreds of other technology and business topics. <a href=\"https://get.oreilly.com/ent_demo-request.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_campaign=techlead+global+nurture&amp;utm_content=em1+radar+overview\">Request a demo.</a></p>\\n</div></div>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/PNgA-4GmKv4\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Here’s a look ahead to 2021 and five of the trends we’re watching closely.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Kubernetes Complexity</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To say that Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration platform is an understatement.&nbsp; It’s the only container orchestration platform that counts. However, to say that Kubernetes is complex is also an understatement.&nbsp; The learning curve is both steep and long. How will developers address Kubernetes’ complexity? We are starting to see some simpler alternatives for specific use cases–for example, K3S for edge computing.&nbsp; Will that trend continue?&nbsp; Or will Kubernetes be subsumed into cloud providers’ management consoles in a way that simplifies the options available to developers (aka “opinionated”)? We don’t know, but we believe that an important trend for the next year will be attempts to simplify cloud orchestration.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Site Reliability and Observability</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The sea change in workplace dynamics brought about by Covid 19 has had a parallel effect on the world of site reliability engineering. Companies for whom an online presence was an afterthought are now finding it essential to survival. And they’re also finding it necessary to keep their online presence available 24&#215;7. So we foresee an increase in the demand for site reliability engineers–but beyond that, we expect an emphasis on the tools that SREs need. Look for a heavy emphasis on system observability and its fruits: high speed, actionable data allowing engineers to understand, prevent, and mitigate outages. Although it’s only part of the story, we’re particularly interested in OpenTelemetry, a vendor neutral standard for collecting system data. OpenTelementery promises an array of more refined and calibrated open source tools for observability in the years ahead.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>GitOps: The Future of DevOps</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For a decade or more, the slogan “Infrastructure as Code” has driven efforts to make configuration programmable. We’ve made lots of progress; and perhaps the best example of that progress is Kubernetes, which orchestrates the deployment, creation, and construction of containers. There’s one more piece (for now) to consider: how do you automate the configuration of Kubernetes itself? How do you make new deployments faster, while minimizing the possibility of human error at the same time? That’s achieved by using Git to manage Kubernetes’ configuration files and any other artifacts it needs to run. When anything changes, a Kubernetes operator manages the process of informing Kubernetes and related orchestration tools and gradually pushing the deployed system to the desired state. GitOps may be the ultimate expression of “Infrastructure as Code”; we expect it to have a big impact in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Cyber Resilience</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Saying that cyber threats will increase, and that attacks will become more dangerous, hardly qualifies as a prediction or a trend. The sophisticated <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/u-s-treasury-commerce-depts-hacked-through-solarwinds-compromise/\">cyber attacks</a> that compromised the U.S. Treasure, Commerce, and Homeland Security departments are, sadly, hardly surprising. What’s more important is how organizations respond to those threats. In the past, most companies have taken a reactive approach to security: address breaches as they happen, and if nothing happens, they’ve spent too much on security. That approach has failed time and time again. In the coming year, we expect companies to take a dynamic, holistic approach that strengthens their security posture. Steps towards resilience include having a robust Identity and Access Management policy by implementing zero trust, MFA, and passwordless authentication.&nbsp; Expect to see increased use of AI and Machine Learning (ML) by both good and bad actors. Bad actors will use AI to find and exploit new vulnerabilities (including vulnerabilities in AI systems themselves); security teams will use AI and ML tools to detect and block attacks, and to automate routine tasks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Multi-cloud and Hybrid Clouds</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s too easy to think of “the cloud” as a place: a single virtual location, with a single provider. But that’s not reality.&nbsp; As IBM has said frequently, the cloud is a capability, not a destination.&nbsp; By the time most companies start thinking seriously about a “cloud strategy,” they already have pilot projects in multiple clouds.&nbsp; Mergers and acquisitions complicate the situation even more, as does data that has to remain on-premises for regulatory or security reasons. What counts isn’t moving applications to a specific provider, but having a uniform interface that lets you use capabilities regardless of their physical location. 2021 will be the year that companies (officially) adopt multi- and hybrid clouds, removing the operational and developmental barriers between their own, on-premises IT and cloud providers. We will discover what it really means to be “cloud-native.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/teams.html\">O’Reilly’s online learning platform</a> can give your employees the resources they need to upskill and stay up to date on Kubernetes, SRE, cybersecurity, cloud, and hundreds of other technology and business topics. <a href=\"https://get.oreilly.com/ent_demo-request.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_campaign=techlead+global+nurture&amp;utm_content=em1+radar+overview\">Request a demo.</a></p>\\n</div></div>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/7xc4nTkzPNs\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

The First Amendment to the US constitution says that the government can’t pass a law that restricts your speech. And neither Twitter nor Facebook are the US government, so whatever they do to block content isn’t a “free speech” issue, at least strictly interpreted.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Admittedly, that narrow view leaves out a lot. Both the right and the left can agree that we don’t really want Zuck or @jack determining what kinds of speech are legitimate. And most of us can agree that there’s a time when abstract principles have to give way to concrete realities, such as terrorists storming the US capitol building. That situation resulted from years of abusive speech that the social platforms had ignored, so that when the corporate power finally stepped in, their actions were too little, too late.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But as I said, the focus on “free speech” misframes the issue. The important issue here isn’t speech itself; it’s how and why speech is amplified—an amplification that can be used to drown out or intimidate other voices, or to selectively amplify voices for reasons that may be well-intended, self-interested, or even hostile to the public interest. The discussion we need, the discussion of amplification and its implications, has largely been supplanted by arguments about “free speech.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the Third Amendment, the US Constitution also guarantees a “free press.” A free press is important because the press has the power of replication: of taking speech and making it available more broadly. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, that largely meant newspapers, which had the ability to reproduce tens of thousands of copies overnight. But freedom of the press has an important limitation. Anyone can talk, but to have freedom of the press you have to have a press–whether that’s a typewriter and a mimeograph, or all the infrastructure of a publisher like The New York TImes, CNN, or Fox News. And being a “press” has its own constraints: an editorial staff, an editorial policy, and so on. Because they’re in the business of replication, it’s probably more correct to think of Twitter and Facebook as exercising “press” functions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But what is the editorial function for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and most other social media platforms? There isn’t an editor who decides whether your writing is insightful. There’s no editorial viewpoint. There’s only the shallowest attempt to verify facts. The editorial function is driven entirely by the desire to increase engagement, and this is done algorithmically. And what algorithms have “learned” perhaps isn’t surprising: showing people content that makes them angry is the best way to keep them coming back for more. And the more they come back, the more ads are clicked, and the more income flows in. Over the past few years, that editorial strategy has certainly played into the hands of the alt-right and neo-Nazi groups, who learned quickly how to take advantage of it. Nor have left-leaning polemicists missed the opportunity. The battle of overheated rhetoric has cheapened the public discourse and made consensus almost unattainable. Indeed, it has made attention itself unattainable: and, as Peter Wang has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pwang/52253dbfe627\">argued</a>, scarcity of attention–particularly the “synchronous attention of a group”–is the biggest problem we face, because it rules out thoughtful consensus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again, that’s been discussed many times over the past few years, but we seem to have lost that thread. We’ve had reproduction—we’ve had a press—but with the worst possible kind of editorial values. There are plenty of discussions of journalistic values and ethics that might be appropriate; but an editorial policy that has no other value than increasing engagement doesn’t even pass the lowest bar. And that editorial policy has left the user communities of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other media vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/defusing-propaganda-feedback-loops-on-the-social-web/\">deafening feedback loops</a>. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social media feedback loops can be manipulated in many ways: by automated systems that reply or “like” certain kinds of content, as well as by individual users who can also reply and “like” by the thousands.&nbsp; And those loops are aided by the platforms’ recommendation systems: either by recommending specific inflammatory posts, or by recommending that users join specific groups. An internal Facebook report showed that, by their own reckoning, 70% of all “civic” groups on Facebook contained “<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/70-of-top-civic-facebook-groups-are-toxic-or-violent-report-finds/\">hate speech, misinformation, violent rhetoric, or other toxic behavior</a>”; and the company has been aware of that since 2016.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where are we left?&nbsp; I would rather not have Zuck and @jack determine what kinds of speech are acceptable. That’s not the editorial policy we want.&nbsp; And we certainly need protections for people saying unpopular things on social media; eliminating those protections cuts both ways. What needs to be controlled is different altogether: it’s the optimization function that maximizes engagement, measured by time spent on the platform. And we do want to hold Zuck and @jack responsible for that optimization function, just as we want the publisher of a newspaper or a television news channel to be responsible for the headlines they write and what they put on their front page. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Simply stripping Section 230 protection strikes me as irrelevant to dealing with what Shoshana Zuboff terms an “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/sunday/facebook-surveillance-society-technology.html\">epistemic coup</a>.” Is the right solution to do away with algorithmic engagement enhancement entirely?&nbsp; Facebook’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-groups/facebook-says-it-will-permanently-stop-recommending-political-groups-to-users-idUSKBN29X00C\">stop recommending political groups to users</a> is a step forward. But they need to go much farther in stripping algorithmic enhancement from their platform. Detecting bots would be a start; a better algorithm for “engagement,” one that promotes well-being rather than anger, would be a great ending point. As Apple CEO Tim Cook, clearly thinking about Facebook, recently <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/tim-cook-may-have-just-ended-facebook.html\">said</a>, &#8220;A social dilemma cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe&#8230;We believe that ethical technology is technology that works for you… It&#8217;s technology that helps you sleep, not keeps you up. It tells you when you&#8217;ve had enough. It gives you space to create or draw or write or learn, not refresh just one more time.&#8221;&nbsp; This reflects Apple’s values rather than Facebook’s (and one would do well to reflect on Facebook’s origins at Harvard); but it is leading towards the right question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Making people angry might increase shareholder value short-term. But that probably isn’t a sustainable business; and if it is, it’s a business that does incredible social damage. The “solution” isn’t likely to be legislation; I can’t imagine laws that regulate algorithms effectively, and that can&#8217;t be gamed by people who are willing to work hard to game them. I guarantee that those people are out there. We can’t say that the solution is to “be better people,” because there are plenty of people who don’t want to be better; just look at the reaction to the pandemic. Just look at the frustration of the many Facebook and Twitter employees who realized that the time to lay aside abstract principles like “free speech” was long before the election. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We could perhaps return to the original idea of “incorporation,” when incorporation <a href=\"https://www.directorsandboards.com/articles/singlepurpose-debate-social-good-uprooted\">meant</a> a “body created by law for the purpose of attaining public ends through an appeal to private interests”–one of Zuboff’s solutions is to “tie data collection to fundamental rights and data use to public services.” However, that would require legal bodies that made tough decisions about whether corporations were indeed working towards “public ends.”&nbsp; As Zuboff points out earlier in her article, it’s easy to look to antitrust, but the Sherman Antitrust Act was largely a failure.&nbsp; Would courts ruling on “public ends” be any different?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the end, we will get the social media we deserve. And that leads to the right question. How do we build social media that maintains social good, rather than destroying it?&nbsp; What kinds of business models are needed to support that kind of social good, rather than merely maximizing shareholder value?</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/NsfBPf08fpI\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

All too often, trends degenerate into horse races over languages and platforms. Look at all the angst heating up social media when TIOBE or RedMonk releases their reports on language rankings. Those reports are valuable, but their value isn’t in knowing what languages are popular in any given month. And that’s what I’d like to get to here: the real trends that aren’t reflected (or at best, are indirectly reflected) by the horse races. Sometimes they’re only apparent if you look carefully at the data; sometimes it’s just a matter of keeping your ear to the ground.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In either case, there’s a difference between “trends” and “trendy.” Trendy, fashionable things are often a flash in the pan, forgotten or regretted a year or two later (like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock\">Pet Rocks</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Pet\">Chia Pets</a>). Real trends unfold on much longer time scales and may take several steps backward during the process: civil rights, for example. Something is happening and, over the long arc of history, it’s not going to stop. In our industry, cloud computing might be a good example.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Methodology</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This study is based on title usage on O’Reilly online learning. The data includes all usage of our platform, not just content that O’Reilly has published, and certainly not just books. We’ve explored usage across all publishing partners and learning modes, from live training courses and online events to interactive functionality provided by Katacoda and Jupyter notebooks. We’ve included search data in the graphs, although we have avoided using search data in our analysis. Search data is distorted by how quickly customers find what they want: if they don’t succeed, they may try a similar search with many of the same terms. (But don’t even think of searching for R or C!) Usage data shows what content our members actually use, though we admit it has its own problems: usage is biased by the content that’s available, and there’s no data for topics that are so new that content hasn’t been developed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven’t combined data from multiple terms. Because we’re doing simple pattern matching against titles, usage for “AWS security” is a subset of the usage for “security.” We made a (very) few exceptions, usually when there are two different ways to search for the same concept. For example, we combined “SRE” with “site reliability engineering,” and “object oriented” with “object-oriented.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The results are, of course, biased by the makeup of the user population of O’Reilly online learning itself. Our members are a mix of individuals (professionals, students, hobbyists) and corporate users (employees of a company with a corporate account). We suspect that the latter group is somewhat more conservative than the former. In practice, this means that we may have less meaningful data on the latest JavaScript frameworks or the newest programming languages. New frameworks appear every day (literally), and our corporate clients won’t suddenly tell their staff to reimplement the ecommerce site just because last year’s hot framework is no longer fashionable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Usage and query data for each group are normalized to the highest value in each group. Practically, this means that you can compare topics within a group, but you can’t compare the groups with each other. Year-over-year (YOY) growth compares January through September 2020 with the same months of 2019. Small fluctuations (under 5% or so) are likely to be noise rather than a sign of a real trend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Enough preliminaries. Let’s look at the data, starting at the highest level: O’Reilly online learning itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>O’Reilly Online Learning</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Usage of O’Reilly online learning grew steadily in 2020, with 24% growth since 2019. That may not be surprising, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in the technology industry. Companies that once resisted working from home were suddenly shutting down their offices and asking their staff to work remotely. Many have said that remote work will remain an option indefinitely. COVID had a significant effect on training: in-person training (whether on- or off-site) was no longer an option, so organizations of all sizes increased their participation in live online training, which grew by 96%. More traditional modes also saw increases: usage of books increased by 11%, while videos were up 24%. We also added two new learning modes, Katacoda scenarios and Jupyter notebooks, during the year; we don’t yet have enough data to see how they’re trending. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to place our growth data in this context. We frequently say that 10% growth in a topic is “healthy,” and we’ll stand by that, but remember that O’Reilly online learning itself showed 24% growth. So while a technology whose usage is growing 10% annually is healthy, it’s not keeping up with the platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As travel ground to a halt, so did traditional in-person conferences. We closed our conference business in March, replacing it with live virtual Superstreams. While we can’t compare in-person conference data with virtual event data, we can make a few observations. The most successful superstream series focused on <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/software-architecture-superstream-series/0636920444961/\">software architecture</a> and <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/oreilly-infrastructure-ops-superstream-series/0636920410027/\">infrastructure and operations</a>. Why? The in-person O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference was small but growing. But when the pandemic hit, companies found out that they really were online businesses—and if they weren’t, they had to become online to survive. Even small restaurants and farm markets were adding online ordering features to their websites. Suddenly, the ability to design, build, and operate applications at scale wasn’t optional; it was necessary for survival. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Programming Languages</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although we’re not fans of the language horse race, programming languages are as good a place as any to start. Figure 1 shows usage, year-over-year growth in usage, and the number of search queries for several popular languages. The top languages for O’Reilly online learning are Python (up 27%), Java (down 3%), C++ (up 10%), C (up 12%), and JavaScript (up 40%). Looking at 2020 usage rather than year-over-year changes, it’s surprising to see JavaScript so far behind Python and Java. (JavaScript usage is 20% of Python’s, and 33% of Java’s.) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Past the top five languages, we see healthy growth in Go (16%) and Rust (94%). Although we believe that Rust’s popularity will continue to grow, don’t get too excited; it’s easy to grow 94% when you’re starting from a small base. Go has clearly established itself, particularly as a language for concurrent programming, and Rust is likely to establish itself for “system programming”: building new operating systems and tooling for cloud operations. Julia, a language designed for mathematical computation, is an interesting wild card. It’s slightly down over the past year, but we’re optimistic about its long term chances.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13620\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-1-1048x748.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 1. Programming languages</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We shouldn’t separate usage of titles specifically aimed at learning a programming language from titles applying the language or using frameworks based on it. After all, many Java developers use Spring, and searching for “Java” misses content only has the word “Spring” in the title. The same is true for JavaScript, with the React, Angular, and Node.js frameworks. With Python, the most heavily used libraries are PyTorch and scikit-learn. Figure 2 shows what happens when you add the use of content about Python, Java, and JavaScript to the most important frameworks for those languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13621\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-2-1048x758.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 2. Programming languages and frameworks combined</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It probably isn’t a surprise that the results are similar, but there are some key differences. Adding usage and search query data for Spring (up 7%) reverses Java’s apparent decline (net-zero growth). Zero growth isn’t inappropriate for an established enterprise language, particularly one owned by a company that has mired the language in controversy. Looking further at JavaScript, if you add in usage for the most popular frameworks (React, Angular, and Node.js), JavaScript usage on O’Reilly online learning rises to 50% of Python’s, only slightly behind Java and its frameworks. However, Python, when added to the heavily used frameworks PyTorch and scikit-learn, remains the clear leader.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to understand what we’ve done though. We’re trying to build a more comprehensive picture of language use that includes the use of various frameworks. We’re not pretending the frameworks themselves are comparable—Spring is primarily for backend and middleware development (though it includes a web framework); React and Angular are for frontend development; and scikit-learn and PyTorch are machine learning libraries. And although it’s widely used, we didn’t assign TensorFlow to any language; it has bindings for Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and it’s not clear which language predominates. (Google Trends suggests C++.) We also ignored thousands (literally) of minor platforms, frameworks, and libraries for all these languages; once you get past the top few, you’re into the noise.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We aren’t advocating for Python, Java, or any other language. None of these top languages are going away, though their stock may rise or fall as fashions change and the software industry evolves. We’re just saying that when you make comparisons, you have to be careful about exactly what you’re comparing. The horse race? That’s just what it is. Fun to watch, and have a mint julep when it’s over, but don’t bet your savings (or your job) on it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If the horse race isn’t significant, just what <em>are </em>the important trends for programming languages? We see several factors changing pro‐ gramming in significant ways:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><em>Multiparadigm languages</em><br />Since last year, O’Reilly online learning has seen a 14% increase in the use of content on functional programming. However, Haskell and Erlang, the classic functional languages, aren’t where the action is; neither shows significant usage, and both are headed down (roughly 20% decline year over year). Object oriented programming is up even more than functional programming: 29% growth since last year. This suggests that the real story is the integration of functional features into procedural and object-oriented languages. Starting with Python 3.0 in 2008 and continuing with Java 8 in 2014, programming languages have added higher-order functions (lambdas) and other “functional” features. Several popular languages (including JavaScript and Go) have had functional features from the beginning. This trend started over 20 years ago (with the Standard Template Library for C++), and we expect it to continue.<br /></li><li><em>Concurrent programming</em><br />Platform data for concurrency shows an 8% year-over-year increase. This isn’t a large number, but don’t miss the story because the numbers are small. Java was the first widely used language to support concurrency as part of the language. In the mid-’90s, thread support was a luxury; Moore’s law had plenty of room to grow. That’s no longer the case, and support for concurrency, like support for functional programming, has become table stakes. Go, Rust, and most other modern languages have built-in support for concurrency. Concurrency has always been one of Python’s weaknesses.<br /></li><li><em>Dynamic versus static typing </em><br />This is another important paradigmatic axis. The distinction between languages with dynamic typing (like Ruby and JavaScript) and statically typed languages (like Java and Go) is arguably more important than the distinction between functional and object-oriented languages. Not long ago, the idea of adding static typing to dynamic languages would have started a brawl. No longer. Combining paradigms to form a hybrid is taking a hold here too. Python 3.5 added type hinting, and more recent versions have added additional static typing features. TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript, is coming into its own (12% year-over-year increase).<br /></li><li><em>Low-code and no-code computing</em><br />It’s hard for a learning platform to gather data about a trend that minimizes the need to learn, but low-code is real and is bound to have an effect. Spreadsheets were the forerunner of low-code computing. When VisiCalc was first released in 1979, it enabled millions to do significant and important computation without learning a programming language. Democratization is an important trend in many areas of technology; it would be surprising if programming were any different. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What’s important isn’t the horse race so much as the features that languages are acquiring, and why. Given that we’ve run to the end of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">Moore’s law</a>, concurrency will be central to the future of programming. We can’t just get faster processors. We’ll be working with microservices and serverless/functions-as-a-service in the cloud for a long time–and these are inherently concurrent systems. Functional programming doesn’t solve the problem of concurrency—but the discipline of immutability certainly helps avoid pitfalls. (And who doesn’t love first-class functions?) As software projects inevitably become larger and more complex, it makes eminent sense for languages to extend themselves by mixing in functional features. We need programmers who are thinking about how to use functional and object-oriented features together; what practices and patterns make sense when building enterprise-scale concurrent software?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Low-code and no-code programming will inevitably change the nature of programming and programming languages:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>There will be new languages, new libraries, and new tools to support no- or low-code programmers. They’ll be very simple. (Horrors, will they look like BASIC? Please no.) Whatever form they take, it will take programmers to build and maintain them.<br /></li><li>We’ll certainly see sophisticated computer-aided coding as an aid to experienced programmers. Whether that means &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/pair-programming-with-ai/\">pair programming with a machine</a>&#8221; or algorithms that can write <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/automated-coding-and-the-future-of-programming/\">simple programs on their own</a> remains to be seen. These tools won’t eliminate programmers; they’ll make programmers more productive.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There will be a predictable <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/databases-coding-real-programming-myth/\">backlash against letting the great unwashed</a> into the programmers’ domain. Ignore it. Low-code is part of a democratization movement that puts the power of computing into more peoples’ hands, and that’s almost always a good thing. Programmers who realize what this movement means won’t be put out of jobs by nonprogrammers. They’ll be the ones becoming more productive and writing the tools that others will use.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether you’re a technology leader or a new programmer, pay attention to these slow, long-term trends. They’re the ones that will change the face of our industry. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Operations or DevOps or SRE</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The science (or art) of IT operations has changed radically in the last decade. There’s been a lot of discussion about operations culture (the movement frequently known as DevOps), continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and site reliability engineering (SRE). Cloud computing has replaced data centers, colocation facilities, and in-house machine rooms. Containers allow much closer integration between developers and operations and do a lot to standardize deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Operations isn’t going away; there’s no such thing as <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/what-is-devops.html\">NoOps</a>. Technologies like Function as a Service (a.k.a. FaaS, a.k.a. serverless, a.k.a. AWS Lambda) only change the nature of the beast. The number of people needed to manage an infrastructure of a given size has shrunk, but the infrastructures we’re building have expanded, sometimes by orders of magnitude. It’s easy to round up tens of thousands of nodes to train or deploy a complex AI application. Even if those machines are all in Amazon’s giant data centers and managed in bulk using highly automated tools, operations staff still need to keep systems running smoothly, monitoring, troubleshooting, and ensuring that you’re not <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/is-cloud-waste-inevitable-as-companies-move-to-the-cloud/\">paying for resources you don’t need</a>. Serverless and other cloud technologies allow the same operations team to manage much larger infrastructures; they don’t make operations go away.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The terminology used to describe this job fluctuates, but we don’t see any real changes. The term “DevOps” has fallen on hard times. Usage of DevOps-titled content in O’Reilly online learning has dropped by 17% in the past year, while SRE (including “site reliability engineering”) has climbed by 37%, and the term “operations” is up 25%. While SRE and DevOps are distinct concepts, for many customers SRE is DevOps at Google scale–and who doesn’t want that kind of growth? Both SRE and DevOps emphasize similar practices: version control (62% growth for GitHub, and 48% for Git), testing (high usage, though no year-over-year growth), continuous deployment (down 20%), monitoring (up 9%), and observability (up 128%). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)\">Terraform</a>, HashiCorp’s open source tool for automating the configuration of cloud infrastructure, also shows strong (53%) growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13622\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-3-1048x788.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 3. Operations, DevOps, and SRE </em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s more interesting to look at the story the data tells about the tools. Docker is close to flat (5% decline year over year), but usage of content about containers skyrocketed by 99%. So yes, containerization is clearly a big deal. Docker itself may have stalled—we’ll know more next year—but Kubernetes’s dominance as the tool for container orchestration keeps containers central. Docker was the enabling technology, but Kubernetes made it possible to deploy containers at scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Kubernetes itself is the other superstar, with 47% growth, along with the highest usage (and the most search queries) in this group. Kubernetes isn’t just an orchestration tool; it’s the <a href=\"https://www.itproportal.com/features/kubernetes-as-a-cloud-native-operating-system/\">cloud’s operating system</a> (or, as Kelsey Hightower has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/775487754868133888\">said</a>, “Kubernetes will be the Linux of distributed systems”). But the data doesn’t show the number of conversations we’ve had with people who think that Kubernetes is just “too complex.” We see three possible solutions:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>A “simplified” version of Kubernetes that isn’t as flexible, but trades off a lot of the complexity. <a href=\"https://k3s.io/\">K3s</a> is a possible step in this direction. The question is, What’s the trade-off? Here’s my version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Pareto principle</a>, also known as the 80/20 rule. Given any system (like Kubernetes), it’s usually possible to build something simpler by keeping the most widely used 80% of the features and cutting the other 20%. And some applications will fit within the 80% of the features that were kept. But most applications (maybe 80% of them?) will require at least one of the features that were sacrificed to make the system simpler.<br /></li><li>An entirely new approach, some tool that isn’t yet on the horizon. We have no idea what that tool is. In Yeats’s words, “What rough beast&#8230;slouches towards Bethlehem to be born”? <br /></li><li>An integrated solution from a cloud vendor (for example, Microsoft’s open source <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-dapr-distributed-runtime-nears-production-readiness/\">Dapr distributed runtime</a>). I don’t mean cloud vendors that provide Kubernetes as a service; we already have those. What if the cloud vendors integrate Kubernetes’s functionality into their stack in such a way that that functionality disappears into some kind of management console? Then the question becomes, What features do you lose, and do you need them? And what kind of vendor lock-in games do you want to play? </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rich ecosystem of tools surrounding Kubernetes (Istio, Helm, and others) shows how valuable it is. But where do we go from here? Even if Kubernetes is the right tool to manage the complexity of modern applications that run in the cloud, the desire for simpler solutions will eventually lead to higher-level abstractions. Will they be adequate?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/observability-a-3-year-retrospective/\">Observability</a> saw the greatest growth in the past year (128%), while monitoring is only up 9%. While observability is a richer, more powerful capability than monitoring—observability is the ability to find the information you need to analyze or debug software, while monitoring requires predicting in advance what data will be useful—we suspect that this shift is largely cosmetic. “Observability” risks becoming the new name for monitoring. And that’s <a href=\"https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-whats-in-a-name/\">unfortunate</a>. If you think observability is merely a more fashionable term for monitoring, you’re missing its value. Complex systems running in the cloud will need true observability to be manageable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Infrastructure is code, and we’ve seen plenty of tools for automating configuration. But Chef and Puppet, two leaders in this movement, are both significantly down (49% and 40% respectively), as is Salt. Ansible is the only tool from this group that’s up (34%). Two trends are responsible for this. Ansible appears to have supplanted Chef and Puppet, possibly because Ansible is multilingual, while Chef and Puppet are tied to Ruby. Second, Docker and Kubernetes have changed the configuration game. Our data shows that Chef and Puppet peaked in 2017, when Kubernetes started an almost exponential growth spurt, as Figure 4 shows. (Each curve is normalized separately to 1; we wanted to emphasize the inflection points rather than compare usage.) Containerized deployment appears to minimize the problem of reproducible configuration, since a container is a complete software package. You have a container; you can deploy it many times, getting the same result each time. In reality, it’s never that simple, but it certainly looks that simple–and that apparent simplicity reduces the need for tools like Chef and Puppet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13623\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-4-1048x782.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 4. Docker and Kubernetes versus Chef and Puppet</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The biggest challenge facing operations teams in the coming year, and the biggest challenge facing data engineers, will be learning how to deploy AI systems effectively. In the past decade, a lot of ideas and technologies have come out of the DevOps movement: the source repository as the single source of truth, rapid automated deployment, constant testing, and more. They’ve been very effective, but AI breaks the assumptions that lie behind them, and deployment is frequently the greatest barrier to AI success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI breaks these assumptions because data is more important than code. We don’t yet have adequate tools for versioning data (though <a href=\"https://dvc.org/\">DVC</a> is a start). Models are neither code nor data, and we don’t have adequate tools for versioning models either (though tools like <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a> are a start). Frequent deployment assumes that the software can be built relatively quickly, but training a model can take days. It’s been suggested that model training doesn’t need to be part of the build process, but that’s really the most important part of the application. Testing is critical to continuous deployment, but the behavior of AI systems is probabilistic, not deterministic, so it’s harder to say that this test or that test failed. It’s particularly difficult if testing includes issues like fairness and bias.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although there is a nascent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps\">MLOps</a> movement, our data doesn’t show that people are using (or searching for) content in these areas in significant numbers. Usage is easily explainable; in many of these areas, content doesn’t exist yet. But users will search for content whether or not it exists, so the small number of searches shows that most of our users aren’t yet aware of the problem. Operations staff too frequently assume that an AI system is just another application—but they’re wrong. And AI developers too frequently assume that an operations team will be able to deploy their software, and they’ll be able to move on to the next project—but they’re also wrong. This situation is a train wreck in slow motion, and the big question is whether we can stop the trains before they crash. These problems will be solved eventually, with a new generation of tools—indeed, those tools are already being built—but we’re not there yet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>AI, Machine Learning, and Data</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Healthy growth in artificial intelligence has continued: machine learning is up 14%, while AI is up 64%; data science is up 16%, and statistics is up 47%. While AI and machine learning are distinct concepts, there’s enough confusion about definitions that they’re frequently used interchangeably. We informally define machine learning as “the part of AI that works”; AI itself is more research oriented and aspirational. If you accept that definition, it’s not surprising that content about machine learning has seen the heaviest usage: it’s about taking research out of the lab and putting it into practice. It’s also not surprising that we see solid growth for AI, because that’s where bleeding-edge engineers are looking for new ideas to turn into machine learning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13624\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-5-1048x760.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 5. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Have the skepticism, fear, and criticism surrounding AI taken a toll, or are “reports of AI’s death greatly exaggerated”? We don’t see that in our data, though there are certainly some metrics to say that <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6494/927\">artificial intelligence has stalled</a>. Many projects never make it to production, and while the last year has seen amazing progress in natural language processing (up 21%), such as OpenAI’s GPT-3, we’re seeing fewer spectacular results like winning Go games. It’s possible that AI (along with machine learning, data, big data, and all their fellow travelers) is descending into the trough of the hype cycle. We don’t think so, but we’re prepared to be wrong. As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benlorica/\">Ben Lorica</a> has said (in conversation), many years of work will be needed to bring current research into commercial products.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s certainly true that there’s been a (deserved) backlash over heavy handed use of AI. A backlash is only to be expected when deep learning applications are used to justify <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882683463/the-computer-got-it-wrong-how-facial-recognition-led-to-a-false-arrest-in-michig\">arresting the wrong people</a>, and when some police departments are comfortable using software with a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535814/uk-face-recognition-police-london-accuracy-completely-comfortable\">98% false positive rate</a>. A backlash is only to be expected when software systems designed to maximize “engagement” end up spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. A backlash is only to be expected when software developers don’t take into account issues of power and abuse. And a backlash is only to be expected when too many executives see AI as a “magic sauce” that will turn their organization around without pain or, frankly, a whole lot of work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we don’t think those issues, as important as they are, say a lot about the future of AI. The future of AI is less about breathtaking breakthroughs and creepy face or voice recognition than it is about small, mundane applications. Think quality control in a factory; think intelligent search <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/answers/search/\">on O’Reilly online learning</a>; think <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/5756257699/nvidia-research-develops-a-neural-network-to-replace-traditional-video-compression\">optimizing data compression</a>; think <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/16/1010617/ai-image-recognition-construction-computer-vision-costs-delays/\">tracking progress on a construction site</a>. I’ve seen too many articles saying that AI hasn’t helped in the struggle against COVID, as if someone was going to click a button on their MacBook and a superdrug was going to pop out of a USB-C port. (And AI has played a huge role in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence/medical-ai/what-ai-can-and-cant-do-in-the-race-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">COVID vaccine development</a>.) AI is playing an important supporting role—and that’s exactly the role we should expect. It’s enabling researchers to navigate tens of thousands of research papers and reports, design drugs and engineer genes that might work, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/teaching-computers-to-read-health-records-is-helping-fight-covid-19-heres-how-147385\">analyze millions of health records</a>. Without automating these tasks, getting to the end of the pandemic will be impossible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So here’s the future we see for AI and machine learning:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Natural language has been (and will continue to be) a big deal. GPT-3 has changed the world. We’ll see AI being used to create “fake news,” and we’ll find that AI gives us the best tools for detecting what’s fake and what isn’t.<br /></li><li>Many companies are placing significant bets on using AI to automate customer service. We’ve made great strides in our ability to synthesize speech, generate realistic answers, and search for solutions.<br /></li><li>We’ll see lots of tiny, embedded AI systems in everything from medical sensors to appliances to factory floors. Anyone interested in the future of technology should watch <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/\">Pete Warden’s work on TinyML</a> very carefully.<br /></li><li>We still haven’t faced squarely the issue of user interfaces for collaboration between humans and AI. We don’t want AI oracles that just replace human errors with machine-generated errors at scale; we want the ability to collaborate with AI to produce results better than either humans or machines could alone. Researchers are <a href=\"http://jessylin.com/2020/06/08/rethinking-human-ai-interaction/\">starting to catch on</a>.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TensorFlow is the leader among machine learning platforms; it gets the most searches, while usage has stabilized at 6% growth. Content about scikit-learn, Python’s machine learning library, is used almost as heavily, with 11% year-over-year growth. PyTorch is in third place (yes, this is a horse race), but usage of PyTorch content has gone up 159% year over year. That increase is no doubt influenced by the popularity of Jeremy Howard’s <a href=\"https://course.fast.ai/\">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> course and the PyTorch-based fastai library (no data for 2019). It also appears that PyTorch is more popular among researchers, while TensorFlow remains dominant in production. But as Jeremy’s students move into industry, and as researchers migrate toward production positions, we expect to see the balance between PyTorch and TensorFlow shift. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Kafka</a> is a crucial tool for building data pipelines; it’s stable, with 6% growth and usage similar to Spark. Pulsar, Kafka’s “next generation” competition, isn’t yet on the map.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools for automating AI and machine learning development (IBM’s <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio/autoai\">AutoAI</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/automl\">Cloud AutoML</a>, Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/automl/\">AutoML</a>, and Amazon’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">SageMaker</a>) have gotten a lot of press attention in the past year, but we don’t see any signs that they’re making a significant dent in the market. That content usage is nonexistent isn’t a surprise; O’Reilly members can’t use content that doesn’t exist. But our members aren’t searching for these topics either. It may be that AutoAI is relatively new or that users don’t think they need to search for supplementary training material.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What about data science? The report <em>What Is Data Science </em>is a decade old, but surprisingly for a 10-year-old paper, views are up 142% over 2019. The tooling has changed though. Hadoop was at the center of the data science world a decade ago. It’s still around, but now it’s a legacy system, with a 23% decline since 2019. Spark is now the dominant data platform, and it’s certainly the tool engineers want to learn about: usage of Spark content is about three times that of Hadoop. But even Spark is down 11% since last year. <a href=\"https://ray.io/\">Ray</a>, a newcomer that promises to make it easier to build distributed applications, doesn’t yet show usage to match Spark (or even Hadoop), but it does show 189% growth. And there are other tools on the horizon: <a href=\"https://dask.org/\">Dask</a> has seen nearly 400% growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s been exciting to watch the discussion of data ethics and activism in the past year. Broader societal movements (such as #BlackLivesMatter), along with increased industry awareness of diversity and inclusion, have made it more difficult to ignore issues like fairness, power, and transparency. What’s sad is that our data shows little evidence that this is more than a discussion. Usage of general content (not specific to AI and ML) about diversity and inclusion is up significantly (87%), but the absolute numbers are still small. Topics like ethics, fairness, transparency, and explainability don’t make a dent in our data. That may be because few books have been published and few training courses have been offered—but that’s a problem in itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Web Development</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since the invention of HTML in the early 1990s, the first web servers, and the first browsers, the web has exploded (or degenerated) into a proliferation of platforms. Those platforms make web development infinitely more flexible: They make it possible to support a host of devices and screen sizes. They make it possible to build sophisticated applications that run in the browser. And with every new year, “desktop” applications look more old-fashioned.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what does the world of web frameworks look like? React leads in usage of content and also shows significant growth (34% year over year). Despite rumors that Angular is fading, it’s the #2 platform, with 10% growth. And usage of content about the server-side platform Node.js is just behind Angular, with 15% growth. None of this is surprising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s more surprising that Ruby on Rails shows extremely strong growth (77% year over year) after several years of moderate, stable performance. Likewise, Django (which appeared at roughly the same time as Rails) shows both heavy usage and 63% growth. You might wonder whether this growth holds for all older platforms; it doesn’t. Usage of content about PHP is relatively low and declining (8% drop), even though it’s still used by <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php\">almost 80%</a> of all websites. (It will be interesting to see how <a href=\"https://www.php.net/archive/2020.php\">PHP 8</a> changes the picture.) And while jQuery shows healthy 18% growth, usage of jQuery content was lower than any other platform we looked at. (Keep in mind, though, that there are literally thousands of web platforms. A complete study would be either heroic or foolish. Or both.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> and <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\">Flask</a> make surprisingly weak showings: for both platforms, content usage is about one-eighth of React’s. Usage of Vue-related content declined 13% in the past year, while Flask grew 10%. Neither is challenging the dominant players. It’s tempting to think of Flask and Vue as “new” platforms, but they were released in 2010 and 2014, respectively; they’ve had time to establish themselves. Two of the most promising new platforms, <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a>, don’t yet produce enough data to chart—possibly because there isn’t yet much content to use. Likewise, <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) doesn’t show up. (It’s also too new, with little content or training material available.) But WebAssembly represents a major rethinking of web programming and bears watching closely. Could WebAssembly turn JavaScript’s dominance of web development on its head? We suspect that nothing will happen quickly. Enterprise customers will be reluctant to bear the cost of moving from an older framework like PHP to a more fashionable JavaScript framework. It costs little to stick with an old stalwart.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13625\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-6-1048x761.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 6. Web development</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The foundational technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all showing healthy growth in usage (22%, 46%, and 40%, respectively), though they’re behind the leading frameworks. We’ve already noted that JavaScript is one of the top programming languages—and the modern web platforms are nothing if not the apotheosis of JavaScript. We find that chilling. The original vision for the World Wide Web was radically empowering and democratizing. You didn’t need to be a techno-geek; you didn’t even need to program—you could just click “view source” in the browser and copy bits you liked from other sites. Twenty-five years later, that’s no longer true: you can still “view source,” but all you’ll see is a lot of incomprehensible JavaScript. Ironically, just as other technologies are democratizing, web development is increasingly the domain of programmers. Will that trend be reversed by a new generation of platforms, or by a reformulation of the web itself? We shall see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Clouds of All Kinds</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s no surprise that the cloud is growing rapidly. Usage of content about the cloud is up 41% since last year. Usage of cloud titles that don’t mention a specific vendor (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) grew at an even faster rate (46%). Our customers don’t see the cloud through the lens of any single platform. We’re only at the beginning of cloud adoption; while <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/cloud-adoption-in-2020/\">most companies</a> are using cloud services in some form, and many have moved significant business-critical applications and datasets to the cloud, we have a long way to go. If there’s one technology trend you need to be on top of, this is it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The horse race between the leading cloud vendors, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, doesn’t present any surprises. Amazon is winning, even ahead of the generic “cloud”—but Microsoft and Google are catching up, and Amazon’s growth has stalled (only 5%). Use of content about Azure shows 136% growth—more than any of the competitors—while Google Cloud’s 84% growth is hardly shabby. When you dominate a market the way AWS dominates the cloud, there’s nowhere to go but down. But with the growth that Azure and Google Cloud are showing, Amazon’s dominance could be short-lived.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What’s behind this story? Microsoft has done an excellent job of reinventing itself as a cloud company. In the past decade, it’s rethought every aspect of its business: Microsoft has become a leader in open source; it owns GitHub; it owns LinkedIn. It’s hard to think of any corporate transformation so radical. This clearly isn’t the Microsoft that declared Linux a “cancer,” and that Microsoft could never have succeeded with Azure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Google faces a different set of problems. Twelve years ago, the company arguably delivered serverless with App Engine. It open sourced Kubernetes and bet very heavily on its leadership in AI, with the leading AI platform TensorFlow highly optimized to run on Google hardware. So why is it in third place? Google’s problem hasn’t been its ability to deliver leading-edge technology but rather its ability to reach customers—a problem that Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud’s CEO, is <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/how-thomas-kurian-s-quite-simple-strategy-is-transforming-google-cloud\">attempting to address</a>. Ironically, part of Google’s customer problem is its focus on engineering to the detriment of the customers themselves. Any number of people have told us that they stay away from Google because they’re too likely to say, “Oh, that service you rely on? We’re shutting it down; we have a better solution.” Amazon and Microsoft don’t do that; they understand that a cloud provider has to support legacy software, and that all software is legacy the moment it’s released.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13626\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-7-1048x776.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 7. Cloud usage </em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While our data shows very strong growth (41%) in usage for content about the cloud, it doesn’t show significant usage for terms like “multicloud” and “hybrid cloud” or for specific hybrid cloud products like Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos\">Anthos</a> or Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc/\">Azure Arc</a>. These are new products, for which little content exists, so low usage isn’t surprising. But the usage of specific cloud technologies isn’t that important in this context; what’s more important is that usage of all the cloud platforms is growing, particularly content that isn’t tied to any vendor. We also see that our corporate clients are using content that spans all the cloud vendors; it’s difficult to find anyone who’s looking at a single vendor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Not long ago, we were skeptical about hybrid and multicloud. It’s easy to assume that these concepts are pipe dreams springing from the minds of vendors who are in second, third, fourth, or fifth place: if you can’t win customers from Amazon, at least you can get a slice of their business. That story isn’t compelling—but it’s also the wrong story to tell. Cloud computing is hybrid by nature. Think about how companies “get into the cloud.” It’s often a chaotic grassroots process rather than a carefully planned strategy. An engineer can’t get the resources for some project, so they create an AWS account, billed to the company credit card. Then someone in another group runs into the same problem, but goes with Azure. Next there’s an acquisition, and the new company has built its infrastructure on Google Cloud. And there’s petabytes of data on-premises, and that data is subject to regulatory requirements that make it difficult to move. The result? Companies have hybrid clouds long before anyone at the C-level perceives the need for a coherent cloud strategy. By the time the C suite is building a master plan, there are already mission-critical apps in marketing, sales, and product development. And the one way to fail is to dictate that “we’ve decided to unify on cloud X.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All the cloud vendors, including Amazon (which until recently<a href=\"https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-forbids-partners-even-mentioning-multi-cloud-529598\"> didn’t even allow its partners to use the word multicloud</a>), are being drawn to a strategy based not on locking customers into a specific cloud but on facilitating management of a hybrid cloud, and all offer tools to support hybrid cloud development. They know that support for hybrid clouds is key to cloud adoption–and, if there is any lock in, it will be around management. As IBM’s Rob Thomas has frequently said, “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ai-ladder/9781492073420/ch04.html\">Cloud is a capability, not a location</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As expected, we see a lot of interest in microservices, with a 10% year-over-year increase—not large, but still healthy. Serverless (a.k.a. functions as a service) also shows a 10% increase, but with lower usage. That’s important: while it “feels like” serverless adoption has stalled, our data suggests that it’s growing in parallel with microservices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Security and Privacy</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security has always been a problematic discipline: defenders have to get thousands of things right, while an attacker only has to discover one mistake. And that mistake might have been made by a careless user rather than someone on the IT staff. On top of that, companies have often underinvested in security: when the best sign of success is that “nothing bad happened,” it’s very difficult to say whether money was well spent. Was the team successful or just lucky?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the last decade has been full of high-profile break-ins that have cost billions of dollars (including increasingly hefty penalties) and led to the <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3510640/7-security-incidents-that-cost-cisos-their-jobs.html\">resignations and firings of C-suite executives</a>. Have companies learned their lessons?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The data doesn’t tell a clear story. While we’ve avoided discussing absolute usage, usage of content about security is very high—higher than for any other topic except for the major programming languages like Java and Python. Perhaps a better comparison would be to compare security with a general topic like programming or cloud. If we take that approach, programming usage is heavier than security, and security is only slightly behind cloud. So the usage of content about security is high, indeed, with year-over-year growth of 35%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13627\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-8-1048x764.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 8. Security and privacy</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But what content are people using? Certification resources, certainly: CISSP content and training is 66% of general security content, with a slight (2%) decrease since 2019. Usage of content about the CompTIA Security+ certification is about 33% of general security, with a strong 58% increase.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a fair amount of interest in hacking, which shows 16% growth. Interestingly, ethical hacking (a subset of hacking) shows about half as much usage as hacking, with 33% growth. So we’re evenly split between good and bad actors, but the good guys are increasing more rapidly. Penetration testing, which should be considered a kind of ethical hacking, shows a 14% decrease; this shift may only reflect which term is more popular.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Beyond those categories, we get into the long tail: there’s only minimal usage of content about specific topics like phishing and ransomware, though ransomware shows a huge year-over-year increase (155%); that increase no doubt reflects the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks in the past year. There’s also a 130% increase in content about “zero trust,” a technology used to build defensible networks—though again, usage is small.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s disappointing that we see so little interest in content about privacy, including content about specific regulatory requirements such as GDPR. We don’t see heavy usage; we don’t see growth; we don’t even see significant numbers of search queries. This doesn’t bode well.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Not the End of the Story</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve taken a tour through a significant portion of the technology landscape. We’ve reported on the horse races along with the deeper stories underlying those races. Trends aren’t just the latest fashions; they’re also long-term processes. Containerization goes back to <a href=\"https://www.section.io/engineering-education/history-of-container-technology/\">Unix version 7 in 1979</a>; and didn’t Sun Microsystems invent the cloud in the 1990s with its workstations and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ray\">Sun Ray</a> terminals? We may talk about “internet time,” but the most important trends span decades, not months or years—and often involve reinventing technology that was useful but forgotten, or technology that surfaced before its time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With that in mind, let’s take several steps back and think about the big picture. How are we going to harness the computing power needed for AI applications? We’ve talked about concurrency for decades, but it was only an exotic capability important for huge number-crunching tasks. That’s no longer true; we’ve run out of Moore’s law, and concurrency is table stakes. We’ve talked about system administration for decades, and during that time, the ratio of IT staff to computers managed has gone from many-to-one (one mainframe, many operators) to one-to-thousands (monitoring infrastructure in the cloud). As part of that evolution, automation has also gone from an option to a necessity. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve all heard that “everyone should learn to program.” This may be correct&#8230;or maybe not. It doesn’t mean that everyone should be a professional programmer but that everyone should be able to use computers effectively, and that requires programming. Will that be true in the future? No-code and low-code products are reaching the market, allowing users to build everything from business applications to AI prototypes. Again, this trend goes way back: in the late 1950s, the first modern programming languages made programming much easier. And yes, even back then there were those who said “real men use machine language.” (And that sexism was no doubt intentional, since the first generation of programmers included many women.) Will our future bring further democratization? Or a return to a cult of “wizards”? Low-code AI and complex JavaScript web platforms offer conflicting visions of what the future may bring.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, the most important trend may not yet appear in our data at all. Technology has largely gotten a free ride as far as regulation and legislation are concerned. Yes, there are heavily regulated sectors like healthcare and finance, but social media, much of machine learning, and even much of online commerce have only been lightly regulated. That free ride is coming to an end. Between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>, the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (which will probably be copied by many states), California Propositions <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/22/\">22</a> and <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/24/\">24</a>, many <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/smart-city-pdx/news/2020/9/9/city-council-approves-ordinances-banning-use-face-recognition\">city ordinances</a> regarding the use of face recognition, and rethinking the meaning of <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/whats-next-section-230-roundup-proposals\">Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act, laws and regulations will play a big role in shaping technology in the coming years. Some of that regulation was inevitable, but a lot of it is a direct response to an industry that moved too fast and broke too many things. In this light, the lack of interest in privacy and related topics is unhealthy. Twenty years ago, we built a future that we don’t really want to live in. The question facing us now is simple:<br /><br />What future will we build? </p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/GkgoCUslcr4\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Slaughter</em></a></cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Variants of artificial intelligence (AI), such as predictive modeling, statistical learning, and machine learning (ML), can create new value for organizations. AI can also cause costly reputational damage, get your organization slapped with a lawsuit, and run afoul of local, federal, or international regulations. Difficult questions about compliance and legality often pour cold water on late-stage AI deployments as well, because data scientists rarely get attorneys or oversight personnel involved in the build-stages of AI systems. Moreover, like many powerful commercial technologies, AI is likely to be highly regulated in the future.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article poses seven legal questions that data scientists should address before they deploy AI. This article is not legal advice. However, these questions and answers should help you better align your organization’s technology with existing and future laws, leading to less discriminatory and invasive customer interactions, fewer regulatory or litigation headwinds, and better return on AI investments. As the questions below indicate, it’s important to think about the legal implications of your AI system as you’re building it. Although many organizations wait until there’s an incident to call in legal help, compliance by design saves resources and reputations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Fairness: </strong>Are there outcome or accuracy differences in model decisions across protected groups? Are you documenting efforts to find and fix these differences?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/ny-regulator-investigating-apple-card-possible-gender-bias-n1079581\">Alleged discrimination in credit lines</a>; <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/regulators-probe-racial-bias-with-unitedhealth-algorithm/563997722/\">Poor experimental design in healthcare algorithms</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Federal regulations require non-discrimination in consumer finance, employment, and other practices in the U.S. Local laws often extend these protections or define separate protections. Even if your AI isn’t directly affected by existing laws today, algorithmic discrimination can lead to <a href=\"https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/google-vision-racism/\">reputational damage</a> and <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/class-action/youtube-sued-for-race-discrimination-profiting-from-hate-speech\">lawsuits</a>, and the current political winds are blowing toward broader regulation of AI. To deal with the issue of algorithmic discrimination and to prepare for pending future regulations, organizations must improve cultural competencies, business processes, and tech stacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology alone cannot solve algorithmic discrimination problems. Solid technology must be paired with culture and process changes, like increased demographic and professional diversity on the teams that build AI systems and better audit processes for those systems. Some additional non-technical solutions involve ethical principles for organizational AI usage, and a general mindset change. Going fast and breaking things isn’t the best idea when what you&#8217;re breaking are people’s loans, jobs, and healthcare.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a technical standpoint, you’ll need to start with careful experimental design and data that truly represents modeled populations. After your system is trained, all aspects of AI-based decisions should be tested for disparities across demographic groups: the system’s primary outcome, follow-on decisions, such as limits for credit cards, and manual overrides of automated decisions, along with the accuracy of all these decisions. In many cases, discrimination tests and any subsequent remediation must also be conducted using legally sanctioned techniques—not just your new favorite Python package. Measurements like adverse impact ratio, marginal effect, and standardized mean difference, along with prescribed methods for fixing discovered discrimination, are enshrined in regulatory commentary. Finally, you should document your efforts to address algorithmic discrimination. Such documentation shows your organization takes accountability for its AI systems seriously and can be invaluable if legal questions arise after deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Privacy</strong>: Is your model complying with relevant privacy regulations?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202007/facial-biometrics-training-dataset-leads-to-bipa-lawsuits-against-amazon-alphabet-and-microsoft\">Training data violates new state privacy laws</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Personal data is highly regulated, <a href=\"https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/\">even in the U.S.</a>, and nothing about using data in an AI system changes this fact. If you are using personal data in your AI system, you need to be mindful of existing laws and watch evolving state regulations, like the <a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/illinois-biometric-information-privacy-act-bipa-when-will-companies-heed-warning\">Biometric Information Privacy Act</a> (BIPA) in Illinois or the new <a href=\"https://www.manatt.com/insights/newsletters/client-alert/the-california-privacy-rights-act-has-passed\">California Privacy Rights Act</a> (CPRA). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To cope with the reality of privacy regulations, teams that are engaged in AI also need to comply with organizational data privacy policies. Data scientists should familiarize themselves with these policies from the early stages of an AI project to help avoid privacy problems. At a minimum, these policies will likely address:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Consent for use:</strong> how consumer consent for data-use is obtained; the types of information collected; and ways for consumers to opt-out of data collection and processing.<br /></li><li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> any applicable privacy regulations to which your data or AI are adhering; why you’re collecting certain information; and associated consumer rights.<br /></li><li><strong>Anonymization requirements:</strong> how consumer data is aggregated and anonymized.<br /></li><li><strong>Retention requirements:</strong> how long you store consumer data; the security you have to protect that data; and if and how consumers can request that you delete their data. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given that most AI systems will change over time, you should also regularly audit your AI to ensure that it remains in compliance with your privacy policy over time. Consumer requests to delete data, or the addition of new data-hungry functionality, can cause legal problems, even for AI systems that were in compliance at the time of their initial deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One last general tip is to have an incident response plan. This is a lesson learned from general IT security. Among many other considerations, that plan should detail systematic ways to inform regulators and consumers if data has been breached or misappropriated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Security:</strong> Have you incorporated applicable security standards in your model? Can you detect if and when a breach occurs?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-ai-company-leaks-over-25m-medical-records\">Poor physical security for AI systems</a>; <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-to-steal-an-ai/\">Security attacks on ML</a>; <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-facial-recognition-fooled-masks.html\">Evasion attacks</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As consumer software systems, AI systems likely fall under various security standards and breach reporting laws. You’ll need to update your organization’s IT security procedures to apply to AI systems, and you’ll need to make sure that you can report if AI systems—data or algorithms—are compromised. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Luckily, the basics of IT security are <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/cybersecurity-small-business/cybersecuirty_sb_factsheets_all.pdf\">well-understood</a>. First, ensure that these are applied uniformly across your IT assets, including that super-secret new AI project and the rock-star data scientists working on it. Second, start preparing for <a href=\"https://github.com/mitre/advmlthreatmatrix\">inevitable attacks on AI</a>. These attacks tend to involve adversarial manipulation of AI-based decisions or the exfiltration of sensitive data from AI system endpoints. While these attacks are not common today, you don’t want to be the object lesson in AI security for years to come. So update your IT security policies to consider these new attacks. Standard counter-measures such as authentication and throttling at system endpoints go a long way toward promoting AI security, but newer approaches such as robust ML, differential privacy, and federated learning can make AI hacks even more difficult for bad actors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, you’ll need to report breaches if they occur in your AI systems. If your AI system is a labyrinthian black-box, that could be difficult. Avoid overly complex, black-box algorithms whenever possible, monitor AI systems in real-time for performance, security, and discrimination problems, and ensure system documentation is applicable for incident response and breach reporting purposes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Agency:</strong> Is your AI system making unauthorized decisions on behalf of your organization?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54698858\">Gig economy robo-firing</a>; <a href=\"https://futurism.com/investing-lawsuit-ai-trades-cost-millions\">AI executing equities trades</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If your AI system is making material decisions, it is crucial to ensure that it cannot make unauthorized decisions. If your AI is based on ML, as most are today, your system&#8217;s outcome is probabilistic: it <em>will</em> make wrong decisions. Wrong AI-based decisions about material matters—lending, financial transactions, employment, healthcare, or criminal justice, among others—can cause serious legal liabilities (see <strong>Negligence</strong> below). Worse still, using AI to mislead consumers can put your organization on the wrong side of an FTC enforcement action or a class action. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every organization approaches risk management differently, so setting necessary limits on automated predictions is a business decision that requires input from many stakeholders. Furthermore, humans should review any AI decisions that implicate such limits before a customer&#8217;s final decision is issued. And don&#8217;t forget to routinely test your AI system with edge cases and novel situations to ensure it stays within those preset limits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Relatedly, and to quote the FTC, &#8220;[d]on&#8217;t deceive consumers about how you use automated tools.&#8221; In their <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2020/04/using-artificial-intelligence-algorithms\"><em>Using Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms</em></a> guidance, the FTC specifically called out companies for manipulating consumers with digital avatars posing as real people. To avoid this kind of violation, always inform your consumers that they are interacting with an automated system. It&#8217;s also a best practice to implement recourse interventions directly into your AI-enabled customer interactions. Depending on the context, an intervention might involve options to interact with a human instead, options to avoid similar content in the future, or a full-blown appeals process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Negligence:</strong> How are you ensuring your AI is safe and reliable?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.thedailyjournal.com/story/news/2019/07/10/nj-vineland-jules-black-christian-rodgers-june-district-court-rodriquez-product-liability-decision/1698558001/\">Releasing the wrong person from jail</a>; <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-crash/in-review-of-fatal-arizona-crash-u-s-agency-says-uber-software-had-flaws-idUSKBN1XF2HA\">autonomous vehicle kills pedestrian</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI decision-making can lead to serious safety issues, including physical injuries. To keep your organization’s AI systems in check, the practice of model risk management–based roughly on the Federal Reserve’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107a1.pdf\">SR 11-7 letter</a>–is among the most tested frameworks for safeguarding predictive models against stability and performance failures.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For more advanced AI systems, a lot can go wrong. When creating autonomous vehicle or robotic process automation (RPA) systems, be sure to incorporate practices from the nascent discipline of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07204\">safe and reliable machine learning</a>. Diverse teams, including domain experts, should think through possible incidents, compare their designs to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08512.pdf\">known past incidents</a>, document steps taken to prevent such incidents, and develop response plans to prevent inevitable glitches from spiraling out of control. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Transparency:</strong> Can you explain how your model arrives at a decision?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong>Proprietary algorithms hide data errors in <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaugust-2017/code-of-silence/\">criminal sentencing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trueallele-software-transforming-how-courts-treat-dna-evidence/\">DNA testing</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Federal law already requires explanations for certain consumer finance decisions. Beyond meeting regulatory requirements, interpretability of AI system mechanisms enables human trust and understanding of these high-impact technologies, meaningful recourse interventions, and proper system documentation. Over recent years, two promising technological approaches have increased AI systems&#8217; interpretability: interpretable ML models and post-hoc explanations. Interpretable ML models (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/interpretml/interpret\">explainable boosting machines</a>) are algorithms that are both highly accurate and highly transparent. Post-hoc explanations (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/slundberg/shap\">Shapley values</a>) attempt to summarize ML model mechanisms and decisions. These two tools can be used together to increase your AI’s transparency. Given both the fundamental importance of interpretability and the technological process made toward this goal, it&#8217;s not surprising that new regulatory initiatives, like the FTC&#8217;s AI guidance and the CPRA, prioritize both consumer-level explanations and overall transparency of AI systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Third Parties:</strong> Does your AI system depend on third-party tools, services, or personnel? Are they addressing these questions?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/09/29/artificial-intelligence-openai-gpt3-toxic/\">Natural language processing tools</a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/03/researchers-show-that-computer-vision-algorithms-pretrained-on-imagenet-exhibit-multiple-distressing-biases/\">training data images</a> conceal discriminatory biases</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is rare for an AI system to be built entirely in-house without dependencies on third-party software, data, or consultants. When you use these third-party resources, third-party risk is introduced into your AI system. And, as the old saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Even if your organization takes the utmost precaution, any incidents involving your AI system, even if they stem from a third-party you relied on, can potentially be blamed on you. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any parties involved in the design, implementation, review, or maintenance of your AI systems follow all applicable laws, policies, and regulations. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before contracting with a third party, due diligence is required. Ask third parties for documentary proof that they take discrimination, privacy, security, and transparency seriously. And be on the lookout for signs of negligence, such as shoddy documentation, erratic software release cadences, lack of warranty, or unreasonably broad exceptions in terms of service or end-user license agreements (EULAs). You should also have contingency plans, including technical redundancies, incident response plans, and insurance covering third-party dependencies. Finally, don&#8217;t be shy about grading third-party vendors on a risk-assessment report card. Make sure these assessments happen over time, and not just at the beginning of the third-party contract. While these precautions may increase costs and delay your AI implementation in the short-term, they are the only way to mitigate third-party risks in your system consistently over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Several U.S. states and federal agencies have telegraphed their intentions regarding the future regulation of AI. Three of the broadest efforts to be aware of include the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304960/congress-algorithmic-accountability-act-wyden-clarke-booker-bill-introduced-house-senate\">Algorithmic Accountability Act</a>, the FTC’s AI guidance, and the CPRA. Numerous other industry-specific guidance documents are being drafted, such as the FDA’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/122535/download?mod=article_inline\">framework</a> for AI in medical devices and FINRA’s <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/ai-report-061020.pdf\"><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Securities Industry</em></a>. Furthermore, other countries are setting examples for U.S. policymakers and regulators to follow. <a href=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/consultations/completed-consultations/consultation-ai/reg-fw_202011/\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0276_EN.pdf\">the European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2020/01/Model-AI-Governance-Framework\">Singapore</a>, and the <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/ai-blog-an-overview-of-the-auditing-framework-for-artificial-intelligence-and-its-core-components/\">United Kingdom</a>, among others, have all drafted or implemented detailed regulations for different aspects of AI and automated decision-making systems. In light of this government movement, and the growing public and government distrust of big tech, now is the perfect time to start minimizing AI system risk and prepare for future regulatory compliance.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/oEkATE7hJc4\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

The idea comes from the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander\">Christopher Alexander</a> in architecture; patterns are things like &#8220;rooms on both sides of a hallway&#8221; or &#8220;door on the front of a building.&#8221;&nbsp; There’s a lot we can unpack from this simple definition:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Design patterns are not invented.&nbsp; They are observed. They aren’t about inventing (or re-inventing) wheels; they’re about noticing “I’ve put wheels on three things lately. Might be a good idea…” The first time you put wheels on something is an invention.&nbsp; It becomes a pattern when you observe that you’re re-inventing the wheel, and that’s a good thing. The wheel becomes part of your repertoire of solutions.<br /></li><li>Design patterns are not algorithms, which are specific solutions to generalized problems.&nbsp;Quicksort isn’t a pattern–nor is sorting itself.&nbsp; Patterns have more to do with how software is organized. They are more like stories, in which a problem leads to a solution that coordinates a number of different parts.<br /></li><li>Design patterns are often used without thinking; they feel natural, not clever, and that’s why they’re common. You’ll find them in your code; you’ll find them in the code of others.&nbsp; You can find them even if they weren’t put there consciously; patterns are often no more than a common solution to a certain kind of problem, something that looks obvious in retrospect. Patterns become a problem when programmers try to force the issue–to use patterns where they don’t quite fit, because they’ve heard that design patterns make their code better.<br /></li><li>Design patterns aren&#8217;t inherently good–and if you read Alexander, you’ll find that there are plenty of architectural patterns that he really doesn’t like. A corridor with rooms on both sides is a solution to certain architectural problems. It is frequently found in very boring hotels and offices.<br /></li><li>&#8220;Anti-patterns&#8221; may be worth avoiding, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t patterns. Frequently observed bad solutions to common problems are still frequently observed solutions to common problems. And sometimes, anti-patterns will be the best possible solution to an otherwise intractable problem. That’s the kind of technical debt that enables you to ship, as <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-exactitude-in-technical-debt/\">Kevlin Henney</a> and <a href=\"https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html\">Ward Cunningham</a> have written.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There isn’t any magic here. While the book <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/\">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides (the “Gang of Four”) is a classic, design patterns really aren’t things you look up in books. Design patterns are things you find in your code; they’d probably be there whether or not they had a name. So what’s the value?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The biggest value in design patterns is that it gives us a common language for talking about software and how it’s organized. That’s why Alexander named one of his books <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/\">A Pattern Language</a>. We’ve all spent hours making diagrams on black- or white-boards to show how some software we’re writing is organized. Design patterns give a common vocabulary so that we can discuss software with some certainty that we all mean the same thing. I eventually realized that UML had the same aim: UML diagrams are like architectural blueprints, in which one kind of line represents a brick wall, another wood, another plasterboard. Unfortunately, UML was never quite standard enough, and like design patterns, was perceived as a good in itself. In the end, a common vocabulary (whether a pattern catalog or UML) is a tool, and any tool can be abused.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since the Gang of Four, design patterns have been associated with object-oriented programming, but the idea that patterns aren’t applicable to functional languages is itself meaningless. It’s certainly true that in functional languages, some well-known patterns (like strategy or map/reduce) are either primitives or simple library functions; but saying that there aren’t patterns in functional programming is equivalent to saying that there are no common solutions to common problems. It’s still useful to point out that the “strategy” pattern is equivalent to passing a function as a parameter to another function. That language gives you an intuitive and descriptive way to discuss solutions to a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Patterns change over time, as problems change; there’s nothing special to the patterns the Gang of Four observed in the 1990s. In the 2020s, we should be building a pattern language for concurrent programming–and we may find that our patterns for the enterprise software of the 90s are less relevant.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You may find that you use patterns without thinking about it; you may discover patterns in your code; you may realize you&#8217;re facing a problem that a pattern will help you to solve; or you may use patterns to describe solutions to someone else. When solving a problem, sometimes the only thing you’re missing is a name; having a name for your solution crystallizes it. Studying patterns is useful because it gives you a larger vocabulary with which to think about problems and solutions. But using patterns for their own sake leads you nowhere. I remember hearing about programmers boasting about how many Gang of Four patterns they used, and managers telling programmers to use more patterns.&nbsp; That’s not productive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like any good thing in programming, using design patterns should help you solve complex problems more simply. But there&#8217;s no guarantee that they&#8217;ll do that. And if you find that they aren&#8217;t, then you should research for some other solutions.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/V-tBrJdLrNo\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Around the world, organizations and their workforces have risen to the occasion, recognizing the importance of expanding their knowledge, taking on new tasks, and bettering themselves both personally and professionally. With the uptick in virtual conferencing, remote work, and, for some, reentering the job market, new technology adoption was accelerated, driving the workforce to build new skills. While 2020 was the year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, it will also be commemorated as the year online learning prevailed. As vaccine development persists and life gets back to normal, with it will come a more future-proof workforce ready to share their new knowledge with the world.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since the onset of the pandemic, online courses and programs have seen dramatic spikes in consumption and enrollment, and O’Reilly has been no different. A big contributor to O’Reilly’s continued success during these unprecedented times has been its live virtual training courses. This year, more than 900,000 users have registered for live events through O’Reilly online learning—a 96% increase from last year. This functionality also allowed O’Reilly to introduce its <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/3299\">Superstream Series</a>, a new lineup of virtual conferences featuring expert speakers delivering talks and training sessions on the most important topics and emerging trends in technology.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what are the trends driving this uptick in learning? Companies are increasingly interested in understanding how to successfully adjust to remote work and effectively manage time. And individual O’Reilly members are looking to build and expand on their technical skills in everything from software architecture and microservices to AI and programming languages. But which topics are the brightest minds in technology most focused on?

Many ideas in functional programming came from Alonzo Church&#8217;s Lambda Calculus, which significantly predates anything that looks remotely like a modern computer. Though the actual history of computing runs differently: in the early days of computing, Von Neumann’s ideas were more important than Church’s, and had a tremendous influence on the design of early computers—an influence that continues to the present. Von Neumann’s thinking was essentially imperative: a program is a list of commands that run on a machine designed to execute those commands.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, what does it mean to say that functional programming is programming &#8220;viewed as mathematics&#8221;? Von Neumann was a “mathematician,” and programming of all kinds found its first home in Mathematics departments. So, if functional programming is mathematical, what does that mean? What kind of math?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m not thinking of any specific branch of mathematics. Yes, the Lambda Calculus has significant ties to set theory, logic, category theory, and many other branches of mathematics. But let’s start with grade school mathematics and assignment statements; they&#8217;re basic to any programming language. We&#8217;re all familiar with code like this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i+1 # or, more simply\\n&nbsp; i += 1&nbsp; # or, even more simply\\n&nbsp; i++ &nbsp; &nbsp; # C, Java, but not Python or Ruby</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mathematically, this is nonsense. An equation is a statement about a relationship that holds true. <code>i</code> can equal <code>i</code>; it can&#8217;t equal <code>i+1</code>. And while <code>i++</code> and <code>i+=1</code> no longer look like equations, they are equally nonsensical; once you&#8217;ve said that <code>i</code> equals something, you can&#8217;t say it equals something else. &#8220;Variables&#8221; don&#8217;t change values; they&#8217;re immutable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Immutability is one of the most important principles of functional programming. Once you&#8217;ve defined a variable, you can&#8217;t change it. (You can create a new one in a different function scope, but that&#8217;s a different matter.) Variables, in functional programming, are invariant; and that&#8217;s important. You may be wondering &#8220;what about loops? How can I write a <code>for</code> loop?&#8221; Not only do you have to do without index variables, you can’t modify any of the variables in the loop body.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Setting aside the (solvable) problem of iteration, there’s no reason you can&#8217;t write code in (almost) any non-functional language that has this same effect. Just declare all your variables <code>final</code> or <code>const</code>. In the long run, functional programming is more about a specific kind of discipline than about language features. Programming languages can enforce certain rules, but in just about any modern language it&#8217;s possible to follow those rules without language support.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another important principle of functional programming is that functions are &#8220;first class entities.&#8221; That is, there are minimal restrictions about where you can use a function. You can also have functions without names, often called &#8220;lambdas” (which refers directly to the Lambda Calculus, in which functions were unnamed).&nbsp; In Python, you can write code like this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;data.sort(key=lambda r: r[COLUMN])</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The &#8220;key&#8221; is an anonymous function that returns a specific column of an array; that function is then used for sorting. Personally, I&#8217;m not overly fond of &#8220;anonymous functions&#8221;; it&#8217;s often clearer to write the anonymous function as a regular, named function. So I might write this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;def sortbycolumn(r): return r[COLUMN]\\n&nbsp; data.sort(k=sortbycolumn)</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The ability to use functions as arguments to functions gives you a very nice way to implement the &#8220;strategy pattern&#8221;:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;def squareit(x): &nbsp; return x*x\\n&nbsp; def cubeit(x): &nbsp; &nbsp; return x*x*x\\n  def rootit(x): &nbsp; &nbsp; import math; return math.sqrt(x)\\n&nbsp; def do_something(strategy, x) ...\\n\\n  do_something(cubeit, 42)\\n  weird = lambda x : cubeit(rootit(x))\\n  do_something(weird, 42)</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I often get the sense that all programmers really<em> </em>want from functional programming is first-class functions and lambdas. Lambdas were added to Python very early on (1.0) but didn&#8217;t reach Java until Java 8.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another consequence of thinking mathematically (and possibly a more important one) is that functions can&#8217;t have side-effects and, given the same arguments, will always return the same value. If a mathematician (or a high school trig student) writes</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;y = sin(x)</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>they don&#8217;t have to deal with the possibility that <code>sin(x)</code> sets some global variable to 42, or will return a different value every time it’s called. That just can&#8217;t happen; in math, the idea of a &#8220;side-effect&#8221; is meaningless. All the information that <code>sin(x)</code> provides is encapsulated in the return value. In most programming languages, side-effects happen all too easily, and in some, they&#8217;re almost an obsession. Again, creating functions that have no side-effects is a matter of exercising discipline. A programming language can enforce this rule, but you can follow it whether or not your language makes you do it. We don’t have cartoon devils looking over our shoulders saying &#8220;Go ahead; make a side effect. No one will notice.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Functional languages vary the degree to which they enforce the lack of side-effects. If you&#8217;re a purist, anything that interacts with the real world is a side-effect. Printing a document? Changing a row in a database? Displaying a value on the user&#8217;s screen? Those are all side-effects (they aren&#8217;t completely encapsulated in the value returned by the function), and they have to be &#8220;hidden&#8221; using a mechanism like monads in Haskell. And that&#8217;s the point at which many programmers get confused and throw up their hands in despair. (I&#8217;ll only point you to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/real-world-haskell/9780596155339/\">Real World Haskell</a>.) In both Java and Python, lambda functions can have side-effects, which means that, strictly speaking, they aren’t really “functional.” Guido van Rossum&#8217;s discussion of the addition of Lambdas to Python is worth reading; among other things, he\\xa0<a href=\"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>\\xa0&#8220;I have never considered Python to be heavily influenced by functional languages, no matter what people say or think.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Streams are often associated with functional languages; they’re essentially long (perhaps infinite) lists that are evaluated lazily—meaning that elements of the string are only evaluated as they&#8217;re needed. Maps apply a function to every element of a list, returning a new list—and that includes streams, which (for these purposes) are specialized lists. That&#8217;s an incredibly useful feature; it&#8217;s a great way to write a loop without having to write a loop—and without even knowing how much data you have. You can also create “filters” that choose whether to pass any element of the stream to the output, and you can chain maps and filters together. If you think this sounds like a Unix pipeline, you’re right. Streams, maps, filters, and the act of chaining them together really have as much to do with the Unix shell as they do with functional languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another way to avoid writing loops is to use &#8220;comprehensions,&#8221; a feature of Python. It&#8217;s easy to get very fond of list comprehensions; they&#8217;re compact, they eliminate off-by-one errors, and they&#8217;re very flexible. Although comprehensions look like a compact notation for a traditional loop, they really come from set theory—and their closest computational “relatives” are to be found in relational databases, rather than functional programming. Here’s a comprehension that applies a function to every element of a list:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;# pythonic examples.&nbsp; First, list comprehension \\n&nbsp; newlist = [ somefunction(thing) for thing in things ] </pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most general way to avoid traditional loops is to use recursion: a function that calls itself. Here’s the recursive equivalent to the previous comprehension:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">def iterate(t, l) :\\n    if len(t) == 0 : return l     # stop when all elements are done\\n    return iterate(t[1:],l + [somefunction(t[0])]) # process remainder</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Recursion is a mainstay of functional languages: you don’t have indices being modified, and you’re not even modifying the resulting list (assuming that append doesn’t count as modification).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, recursion has its own problems. It&#8217;s hard to wrap your mind around recursion; you still need to do a lot of your own bookkeeping (in this case, passing in a vector so a result can be returned); and except in one (common) special case, called &#8220;tail recursion,&#8221; it can be a performance nightmare.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I started by saying that functional programming was programming considered as “math,” and that’s at least partially correct. But is that claim useful? There are many branches of mathematics that map onto programming concepts in different ways. Functional programming only represents one of them. If you’re a topologist, you may well like graph databases. But discussing which branch of mathematics corresponds to which programming practices isn’t really helpful. Remembering high school algebra may help when thinking about immutability, statelessness, and the absence of side-effects; but most programmers will never study the real mathematical origins of functional programing. Lambdas are great; functions as arguments in method calls is great; even recursion is (sometimes) great; but we’re fooling ourselves if we think programmers are going to start using Java as if it were Haskell. But that’s OK; for Java programmers, the value of Lambdas isn’t some mathematical notion of “functional,” but in providing a huge improvement over anonymous inner classes. The tools to be functional are there, should you choose to use them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In college, I learned that engineering was about making tradeoffs. Since then, I’ve heard very few programmers talk about tradeoffs—but those tradeoffs are still central to good engineering. And while engineering uses a lot of mathematics, engineering isn’t mathematics, in part because mathematics doesn’t deal in tradeoffs. Using “mathematics” as a way to think about a particular style of disciplined coding maybe be useful, particularly if that discipline leads to fewer bugs. It’s also useful to use the tools of mathematics to make good tradeoffs between rigor, performance, and practicality—which may lead you in an entirely different direction. Be as functional as you need to (but no more).&nbsp;<br /></p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/f62LG1ACBmI\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

ReBeL builds on the RL+Search algorithms like AlphaZero that have proved successful in perfect-information games. Unlike those previous AIs, however, ReBeL makes decisions by factoring in the probability distribution of different beliefs each player might have about the current state of the game, which we call a public belief state (PBS). In other words, ReBeL can assess the chances that its poker opponent thinks it has, for example, a pair of aces.</i></li><li><a href=\"https://btw.informatik.uni-rostock.de/download/tagungsband/B6-1.pdf\">In-Database Machine Learning</a> &#8212; <i>We demonstrate our claim by implementing tensor algebra and stochastic gradient descent using lambda expressions for loss functions as a pipelined operator in a main memory database system.

So Lupas set a special challenge: a membrane protein from a species of archaea, an ancient group of microbes. For 10 years, his research team tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein. &#8220;We couldn’t solve it.&#8221; But AlphaFold had no trouble. It returned a detailed image of a three-part protein with two long helical arms in the middle. The model enabled Lupas and his colleagues to make sense of their x-ray data; within half an hour, they had fit their experimental results to AlphaFold’s predicted structure. &#8220;It’s almost perfect,&#8221; Lupas says. &#8220;They could not possibly have cheated on this.

Software is not the tangible, kickable stuff our senses are tuned to, so we draw on metaphor to communicate and reason about it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The 1970s offered up <em>spaghetti code</em> to describe the tangle of unstructured control flow. This has inspired many software-as-pasta descriptions, from lasagne for layered architectures to ravioli for—pick a decade—objects, components, modules, services, and microservices. Beyond its disordered arrangement, however, spaghetti has little to offer us as a metaphor. It doesn&#8217;t provide us with a useful mental model for talking about code, and has far too many positive associations. If you love both ravioli and spaghetti, it&#8217;s not obvious that one of these is worse for your software architecture than the other.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A metaphor is a mapping that we use to describe one thing in terms of another—sometimes because we want to show something familiar from an unfamiliar angle, as in poetry, but sometimes because we want to show something unfamiliar or abstract in a more familiar light, as in software. To be considered good, a metaphor has to offer a number of points of useful correspondence with what is being described. Pasta doesn&#8217;t quite do this.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another quality of a good metaphor is that it should not have too many obvious points of conflict. It will never map its target perfectly—a metaphor is a conceit not an identity—but a good metaphor is one whose key qualities don&#8217;t contradict the very thing we are trying to say, whose points of difference don&#8217;t distract from the mental model being shared.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We sometimes talk about <em>code decay</em> and <em>software rot</em>. These terms give a sense of degradation over time. This seems accurate and relatable. They also suggest a response: cleaning (we brush our teeth to reduce the chance of tooth decay) or treatment (we treat wood to avoid it rotting). So far so good… but the problem with these metaphors is they refer to natural processes that happen independently of anything we do. If you don&#8217;t brush your teeth, you will experience decay. If you don&#8217;t touch code, it doesn&#8217;t intrinsically degrade.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The third quality of a metaphor that makes it effective is familiarity to its audience. Explaining something unfamiliar in terms of something else that is also unfamiliar can be a long road to travel a short distance (or to end up where you started). If you are familiar with the concept of entropy in statistical mechanics, with the second law of thermodynamics, and with the idea that work is needed to reduce entropy and increase order in a system, then <em>software entropy</em> might strike you as a descriptive metaphor—and not simply because the word <em>work</em> transfers happily from the world of thermodynamics to the day-to-day experience of developers. If, however, these concepts are not accessible and require explanation, then, regardless of its other merits, <em>software entropy</em> may not be the best way to talk about accidental complexity in code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps the most popular metaphor in use is based on financial debt, originating with Ward Cunningham in <a href=\"http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html\">1992</a>. As Martin Fowler described in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030919182513/http://martinfowler.com:80/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html\">2003</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Technical Debt is a wonderful metaphor developed by Ward Cunningham to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we look at <em>technical debt</em>, we see a metaphor that checks all three boxes: it has a number of useful points of correspondence; the points of difference don&#8217;t overwhelm the core idea; it is familiar. Furthermore, it brings with it a useful working vocabulary. For example, consider what the following debt-related words suggest to you in a software context: repayment, consolidation, creditworthiness, write-off, borrowing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although we know that by definition no metaphor is perfect, there are two common ways in which the metaphor is misapplied: assuming technical debt is necessarily something bad; equating technical debt with a financial debt value. The emphasis of the former is misaligned and the latter is a category error.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we are relying on the common experience of our audience, financial debt is almost always thought of as a burden. If we take that together with the common experience of code quality and nudge it with leading descriptions such as &#8220;quick and dirty,&#8221; it is easy to see how in everyday use <em>technical debt</em> has become synonymous with poor code and poor practice. We are, however, drawing too heavily on the wrong connotation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than reckless debt, such as from gambling, we should be thinking more along the lines of prudent debt, such as a mortgage. A mortgage should be offered based on our credit history and our ability to pay and, in return, we are able to buy a house that might otherwise have been beyond our reach. Similarly, Ward&#8217;s original motivation was to highlight how debt in code can be used for competitive advantage:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This comes with a clear caveat and implication: a debt is a loan. A debt is for repayment, not for running up:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As in the real world, how we run up debt and how we manage it turn out to be more complex than the simplicity of our best intentions. There are teams that make time-saving decisions wisely, revisiting and addressing them later in a timely manner. But in most cases where debt is incurred, discussed, and lamented, codebases reflect the firefight of different priorities, skills, and people. It&#8217;s still technical debt, but it lacks the prudence and intention of Ward&#8217;s original purpose.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are also teams and tools that embrace the debt metaphor so tightly that they forget it&#8217;s a metaphor. They treat it literally and numerically, converting code quality into a currency value on a spreadsheet or dashboard. The consequences of this <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thinko\">thinko</a> range from being a harmless fiction largely ignored by developers and managers to a more damaging numerology that, even though it&#8217;s well intentioned, can mislead development effort.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we&#8217;re going to quantify it, what is it we&#8217;re quantifying? Do we list off code smells? What is the debt value of a code smell? Is it constant per kind of code smell? For example, is duplicate code characterised by a single cost? And are code smells independent of one another? Consider that, for example, duplication is sometimes used to reduce coupling, so the debit becomes a credit in that context. We can conclude that a code smell is not an isolated thing with a single look-up debt value, so this is clearly a more complex problem dependent on many factors. As a multivariable problem, what does it depend on? And how? And how do we know? And what would the value or—more likely—value distribution reflect? The cost of fixing? Or, more honestly, an estimate of the cost of fixing?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But even if we are somehow able to conjure a number out of this ever-growing list of considerations—and even if that number has some relation to observed reality—we have put a number to the wrong quantity. We have, in fact, missed the whole point of the metaphor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technical debt is not the cost of repaying the debt: it is the cost of owning the debt. These are not the same. That is the message of the technical debt metaphor: it is not simply a measure of the specific work needed to repay the debt; it is the additional time and effort added to all past, present, and future work that comes from having the debt in the first place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By taking the metaphor literally, we have robbed it of its value. Its value is to offer us a figure of speech not of currency, a mental model for talking and reasoning about qualities of our code that are not simply stated in code. No matter how well meant, pushing any metaphor beyond its applicability leads to <a href=\"https://weeklysift.com/2011/10/24/expand-your-vocabulary-metaphor-shear/\">metaphor shear</a>.

Over the past two decades, we&#8217;ve seen the rise of hybrid programming languages that combine both functional and object-oriented features. Some of these languages (like Scala) were multi-paradigm from the beginning. Others, like Python (in the transition from Python 2 to 3) or Java (with the introduction of Lambdas in Java 8) are object-oriented or procedural languages to which functional features were added. Although we think of C++ as an object-oriented language, it has also been multi-paradigm from the beginning. It started with C, a procedural language, and added object-oriented features. Later, beginning with the Standard Template Library, C++ was influenced by many ideas from Scheme, a descendant of LISP.\\xa0 JavaScript was also heavily influenced by Scheme, and popularized the idea of anonymous functions and functions as first class objects. And JavaScript was object-oriented from the start, with a prototype-based object model and syntax (though not semantics) that gradually evolved to become similar to Java’s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also seen the rise of languages combining static and dynamic typing (TypeScript in the JavaScript world; the addition of optional type hinting in Python 3.5; Rust has some limited dynamic typing features). Typing is another dimension in paradigm space. Dynamic typing leads to languages that make programming fun and where it’s easy to be productive, while strict typing makes it significantly easier to build, understand, and debug large systems. It’s always been easy to find people praising dynamic languages, but, except for a few years in the late 00s, the dynamic-static paradigmatic hasn’t attracted as much attention.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why do we still see holy wars between advocates of functional and object-oriented programming? That strikes me as a huge missed opportunity. What might &#8220;multi-paradigm programming&#8221; mean? What would it mean to reject purity and use whatever set of features provide the best solution in any given context? Most significant software is substantial enough that it certainly has components where an object-oriented paradigm makes more sense, and components where a functional paradigm is superior.\\xa0 For example, look at a “functional” feature like recursion.\\xa0 There are certainly algorithms that make much more sense recursively (Towers of Hanoi, or printing a sorted binary tree in order); there are algorithms where it doesn’t make much of a difference whether you use loops or recursion (whenever tail recursion optimizations will work); and there are certainly cases where recursion will be slow and memory-hungry. How many programmers know which solution is best in any situation?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These are the sort of questions we need to start asking. Design patterns have been associated with object-oriented programming from the beginning. What kinds of design patterns make sense in a multi-paradigm world? Remember that design patterns aren&#8217;t &#8220;invented&#8221;; they&#8217;re observed, they&#8217;re solutions to problems that show up again and again, and that should become part of your repertoire. It&#8217;s unfortunate that functional programmers tend not to talk about design patterns; when you realize that patterns are observed solutions, statements like &#8220;patterns aren&#8217;t needed in functional languages&#8221; cease to make sense. Functional programmers certainly solve problems, and certainly see the same solutions show up repeatedly. We shouldn’t expect those problems and solutions to be the same problems and solutions that OO programmers observe. What patterns yield the best of both paradigms? What patterns might help to determine which approach is most appropriate in a given situation?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Programming languages represent ways of thinking about problems. Over the years, the paradigms have multiplied, along with the problems we’re interested in solving. We now talk about event-driven programming, and many software systems are event-driven, at least on the front end. Metaprogramming was popularized by JUnit, the first widely used tool to rely on this feature that’s more often associated with functional languages; since then, several drastically different versions of metaprogramming have made new things possible in Java, Ruby, and other languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&#8217;ve never really addressed the problem of how to make these paradigms play well together; so far, languages that support multiple paradigms have left it to the programmers to figure out how to use them. But simply mixing paradigms ad hoc probably isn’t the ideal way to build large systems–and we&#8217;re now building software at scales and speeds that were hard to imagine only a few years ago. Our tools have improved; now we need to learn how to use them well. And that will inevitably involve blending paradigms that we’ve long viewed as distinct, or even in conflict.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Thanks to Kevlin Henney for ideas and suggestions!</em></p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/mA0IUyEp8u0\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

We do so out of genuine curiosity as well as professional necessity: Q is an ML/AI consultant, Chris is a product manager in the AI space, and Shane is an attorney.&nbsp; While we approach our questions from different angles because of our different roles,&nbsp; we all have the same goal in mind: we want to elicit truth and get people working with us to dig deeper into an issue. Preferably before things get out of hand, but sometimes precisely because they have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A recent discussion led us down the path of our favorite questions: what they are, why they&#8217;re useful, and when they don&#8217;t work so well.&nbsp; We then each chose our top three questions, which we&#8217;ve detailed in this article.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We hope you&#8217;re able to borrow questions you haven&#8217;t used before, and even cook up new questions that are more closely related to your personal and professional interests.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>What makes a good question?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before we get too far, let&#8217;s explore what we mean by a &#8220;good question.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For one, it&#8217;s <em>broad and open-ended</em><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; It&#8217;s a lot less &#8220;did this happen?&#8221; and more &#8220;what happened?&#8221;&nbsp; It encourages people to share their thoughts and go deep.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s an implied &#8220;tell me more&#8221; in an open-ended question.&nbsp; Follow it with silence, and (as any professional interrogator will tell you) people will fill in extra details.&nbsp;They will get to <em>what</em> happened, along with <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> and <em>why.</em>&nbsp; They will tell a full story, which may then lead to more questions, which branch into other stories. All of this fills in more pieces to the puzzle.&nbsp; Sometimes, it sheds light on parts of the puzzle you didn&#8217;t know existed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By comparison, yes/no questions implicitly demand nothing more than what was expressly asked.&nbsp; That makes them too easy to dodge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two, a good question <em>challenges the person asking it</em> as much as (if not more than) the person who is expected to answer.&nbsp; Anyone can toss out questions at random, in an attempt to fill the silence. To pose <em>useful</em> questions requires that you first understand the present situation, know where you want to wind up, and map out stepping-stones between the two.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Case in point: the Daniel Pennac line that opened this piece was uttered by a detective who was &#8220;interviewing&#8221; a person in a coma.&nbsp; As he inspected their wounds, he asked more questions to&nbsp; explore their backstory, and that helped him to piece together his next steps of the investigation.&nbsp; Perhaps Inspector Pennac was inspired by Georg Cantor, who once said: &#8220;To ask the right question is harder than to answer it.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Three, a good question <em>doesn&#8217;t always have a right answer</em>.&nbsp; Some of them don&#8217;t have any answer at all.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s fine. Sometimes the goal of asking a question is to break the ice on a topic, opening a discussion that paints a larger picture.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Four, sometimes a question is effective precisely because<em> it comes from an unexpected place or person</em>.&nbsp;While writing this piece, one author pointed out (spoiler alert) that the attorney asked all of the technical questions, which seems odd, until you realize that he&#8217;s had to ask those because other people did not. When questions seem to come out of nowhere—but they are really born of experience—they can shake people out of the fog of status quo and open their eyes to new thoughts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>A brief disclaimer</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The opinions presented here are personal, do not reflect the view of our employers, and are not professional product, consulting, or legal advice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The questions</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What does this company <em>really</em> do?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> This is the kind of question you sometimes have to ask three times.&nbsp;The first time, someone will try to hand you the company&#8217;s mission statement or slogan.&nbsp;The second time, they&#8217;ll provide a description of the company: industry vertical, size, and revenue.&nbsp;So you ask again, this time with an emphasis on the <em>really</em>.&nbsp;And then you wait for the question to sink in, and for the person to work backwards from all of the company&#8217;s disparate activities to see what it&#8217;s all truly <em>for.</em>&nbsp;Which will be somewhere between the <em>raison d&#8217;etre </em>and the <em>sine qua non.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Taking the time to work this out is like building a mathematical model: if you understand what a company <em>truly</em> does, you don&#8217;t just get a better understanding of the present, but you can also predict the future.&nbsp;It guides decisions such as what projects to implement, what competitors to buy, and whom to hire into certain roles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a concrete example, take Amazon.&nbsp;Everyone thinks it&#8217;s a store. It <em>has</em> a store, but at its core, Amazon is a delivery/logistics powerhouse.&nbsp; Everything they do has to end with your purchases winding up in your hot little hands. Nothing else they do matters—not the slick website, not the voice-activated ordering, not the recommendation engine—unless they get delivery and logistics down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I explore this early in a consulting relationship.&nbsp;Sometimes even early in the sales cycle. And I don&#8217;t try to hide it; I&#8217;ll ask it, flat-out, and wait for people to fill the silence.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> My work focuses on helping companies to start, restart, and assess their ML/AI efforts. Understanding the company&#8217;s true purpose unlocks the business model and sheds light on what is useful to do with the data. As a bonus, it can also highlight cases of conflict.&nbsp;Because sometimes key figures have very different ideas of what the company is and what it should do next.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> This question can catch people off-guard.&nbsp; Since I work in the AI space, people sometimes have a preconceived notion that I&#8217;ll only talk about data and models.&nbsp; Hearing this question from an ostensibly technical person can be jarring… though, sometimes, that can actually help the conversation along.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s definitely a double-edged sword.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What is a bad idea?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> Ideation is about coming up with the &#8220;best&#8221; ideas. What is the best way to solve this problem? What is the most important? What is best for the business?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem with &#8220;best&#8221; is that it is tied up with all of the biases and assumptions someone already has. To get to what really matters we have to understand the edge of what is good or bad. The gray area between those tells you the shape of the problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Half the time this question will give you real, bad ideas.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What has been surprising to me is that the other half of the time, the so-called &#8220;bad&#8221; idea is really a &#8220;good&#8221; idea in disguise.&nbsp; You just have to relax certain assumptions. Often these assumptions were just set at some point without a reason or much to back it up.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I like to ask this after going through a lot of the &#8220;best&#8221; questions in an ideation session. It can be adapted to focus on different types of &#8220;bad,&#8221; like &#8220;stupid,&#8221; &#8220;wasteful,&#8221; and &#8220;unethical.&#8221;&nbsp; Ask follow up questions about why they believe the idea is &#8220;bad&#8221; and why it might actually be &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> How can you truly know what is good without also knowing what is bad?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> When I was a design consultant working for clients in highly regulated industries (.e.g banking, insurance, etc.), I found this can be a difficult question to ask. In those cases you will need to get your legal team to either grant the attorney/client privilege to ask the questions, or ask the prompt/response in such a way that it protects people in the conversation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>How did you obtain your training data?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> In the early days of ML training data, companies and research teams frequently used “some stuff we found on the Internet” as a source for training data. This approach has two problems: (1) there may not be an appropriate license attached to the data, and (2) the data may not be a good representative sample for the intended use. It’s worth noting that the first issue is not just limited to images collected from the Internet. In recent years a number of research datasets (including Stanford’s Brainwash, Microsoft’s MS Celeb, and Duke’s MTMC) were withdrawn for reasons including a lack of clarity around the permission and rights granted by people appearing in the datasets. More recently, at least one company has earned itself significant PR and legal controversy for collecting training data sources from social media platforms under circumstances that were at least arguably a violation of both the platform’s terms of service and platform users&#8217; legal rights.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The safest course of action is also the slowest and most expensive: obtain your training data as part of a collection strategy that includes efforts to obtain the correct representative sample under an explicit license for use <em>as training data</em>. The next best approach is to use existing data collected under broad licensing rights that include use as training data even if that use was not the explicit purpose of the collection.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I like to ask this as early as possible.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t want to invest your time, effort, and money building models only to later realize that you can’t use them, or that using them will be much more expensive than anticipated because of unexpected licenses or royalty payments. It’s also a good indirect measure of training data quality: a team that does not know where their data originated is likely to not know other important details about the data as well.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> No matter how the data is collected, a review by legal counsel before starting a project—and allow me to emphasise the word <em>before</em>—can prevent significant downstream headaches.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong>&nbsp; This question is most useful when asked before the model goes into production. It loses value once the model is on sale or in service, particularly if it is embedded in a hardware device that can’t be easily updated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What is the intended use of the model? How many people will use it? And what happens when it fails?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> One of the most interesting aspects of machine learning (ML) is its very broad applicability across a variety of industries and use cases. ML can be used to identify cats in photos as well as to guide autonomous vehicles. Understandably, the potential harm caused by showing a customer a dog when they expected to see a cat is significantly different from the potential harm caused by an autonomous driving model failing to properly recognize a stop sign.&nbsp; Determining the risk profile of a given model requires a case-by-case evaluation but it can be useful to think of the failure risk in three broad categories:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might die or have their sensitive data exposed”</em> — Examples of these kinds of uses include automated driving/flying systems and biometric access features. ML models directly involved in critical safety systems are generally easy to identify as areas of concern. That said, the risks involved require a very careful evaluation of the processes used to generate, test, and deploy those models, particularly in cases where there are significant public risks involved in any of the aforementioned steps.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might lose access to an important service”</em> — Say, payment fraud detection and social media content detection algorithms.&nbsp;Most of us have had the experience of temporarily losing access to a credit card for buying something that “didn’t fit our spending profile.” Recently, a law professor who <em>studies</em> automated content moderation was suspended … by a social media platform&#8217;s automated content moderation system. All this because they quoted a reporter who <em>writes</em> about automated content moderation. These kinds of service-access ML models are increasingly used to make decisions about what we can spend, what we can say, and even where and how we can travel. The end-user risks are not as critical as in a safety or data protection system, but their failure can represent a significant reputation risk to the business that uses them when the failure mode is to effectively ban users from a product or service. It is important for companies employing ML in these situations to understand how this all fits into the overall risk profile of the company. They&#8217;d do well to carefully weigh the relative merit of using ML to <em>augment</em> existing controls and human decision-making versus <em>replace</em> those controls and leave the model as the sole decision-maker.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, people may be mildly inconvenienced or embarrassed”</em> —&nbsp; Such systems include image classifiers, recommendation engines, and automated image manipulation tools. In my experience, companies significantly understate the potential downside for ML failures that, while only inconvenient to individual users, can carry significant PR risk in the aggregate. A company may think that failures in a shopping recommendation algorithm are “not a big deal” until the algorithm suggests highly inappropriate results to millions of users for an innocuous and very common query.&nbsp; Similarly, employees working on a face autodetection routine for a camera may think occasional failures are insignificant until the product is on sale and users discover that the feature fails to recognize faces with facial hair, or a particular hairstyle, or a particular range of skin color.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I use this question to determine both the potential risk from an individual failure and the potential aggregate risk from a systemic failure.&nbsp; It also feeds back into my question about training data: some relatively minor potential harms are worth additional investment in training data and testing if they could inconvenience millions, or billions, of users or create a significant negative PR cycle for a company.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> This is the sort of question that gets people thinking about the importance of their model in the overall business. It can also be a helpful guide that companies invest in such a model, and the kinds of business processes that are amenable to models.&nbsp; Remember that models that work nearly perfectly can still fail spectacularly in unusual situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> We don’t always have the luxury of time or accurate foresight.&nbsp;Sometimes a business does not know how a model will be used: a model is developed for Product X and repurposed for Product Y, a minor beta feature suddenly becomes an overnight success, or a business necessity unexpectedly forces a model into widespread production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What&#8217;s the cost of doing nothing?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> A consultant is an agent of change.&nbsp;When a prospect contacts me to discuss a project, I find it helpful to compare the cost of the desired change to the cost of another-change or even to the cost of the not-change. &#8220;What happens if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> do this?&nbsp;What costs do you incur, what exposures do take on now? And six months from now?&#8221;&nbsp;A high cost of doing nothing means that this is an urgent matter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some consultants will tell you that a high cost of doing nothing is universally great (it means the prospect is ready to move) and a low cost is universally bad (the prospect isn&#8217;t really interested).&nbsp; I see it differently: we can use that cost of doing nothing as a guide to how we define the project&#8217;s timeline, fee structure, and approach. If the change is extremely urgent—a very high cost of doing nothing—it may warrant a quick fix now, soon followed by a more formal approach once the system is stable. A low cost of doing nothing, by comparison, means that we can define the project as &#8220;research&#8221; or &#8220;an experiment,&#8221; and move at a slower pace.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it:</strong> I will ask this one, flat-out, once a consulting prospect has outlined what they want to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> Besides helping to shape the structure of the project, understanding the cost of doing nothing can also shed light on the prospect&#8217;s motivations. That, in turn, can unlock additional information that can be relevant to the project.&nbsp;(For example, maybe the services I provide will help them reach the desired change, but that change won&#8217;t really help the company.&nbsp;Perhaps I can refer them to someone else in that case.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> Sometimes people don&#8217;t have a good handle on the risks and challenges they (don&#8217;t) face.&nbsp;They may hastily answer that this is an urgent matter when it&#8217;s not; or they may try to convince you that everything is fine when you can clearly see that the proverbial house is on fire. When you detect that their words and the situation don&#8217;t align, you can ask them to shed light on their longer-term plans.&nbsp;That may help them to see the situation more clearly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>How would we know we are wrong?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> This is something that was inspired from the intersection of an incredibly boring decision-science book and roadmap planning. Decision trees and roadmaps are very useful when building out the possible spaces of the future. However, for both decision trees and roadmaps we are usually overly optimistic in how we will proceed.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>We fail at properly considering failure.</em>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To appropriately plan for the future we must consider the different ways we can be wrong. Sometimes it will be at a certain decision point (“we didn’t get enough signups to move forward”) or an event trigger (“we see too many complaints”).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we consider this wrong-ness and the possible next step, we can start to normalize this failure and make better decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it:&nbsp; </strong>It&#8217;s best to ask this when you find that certainty is at a high point for the project. More often than not, people don’t consider ways to detect that they need to change course.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> You build a map into the future based on what you can detect. This helps make hard decisions easier because you are effectively practicing the decision process before you are in the heat of the moment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> When things are currently going &#8220;wrong&#8221; it can be a sensitive subject for people. I’ve found it is easier to talk about how to get out of a current wrong situation than considering additional future situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What upstream obligations do you have, and what downstream rights do you want to retain?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> Imagine you employ a vendor to provide or enrich your training data, or you pay for consulting services related to ML.&nbsp;What happens to the information used by the vendors to build your product?&nbsp; Their downstream rights there run the gamut from “absolutely nothing” to “retaining a full copy of the training data, labels, trained models, and test results.” The median position, in my observation, tends to be that the vendor retains control of any new techniques and information derived from the work that would be useful <em>in general,</em> such as new methods of programmatically applying error correction to a trained model, but not the specific data used to train the model or the resulting trained model.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From the customer perspective, downstream rights are tied to competition/cost tradeoffs and the rights associated with training data.&nbsp; A company that considers ML a competitive advantage likely will not want their models or derivative data available to competitors, and they must balance this against the business consideration that vendors which retain downstream rights typically charge lower fees (because reselling that data or models can be a source of revenue). In addition, training data usually comes with contractual limitations and customers of ML services need to ensure they are not granting downstream rights that they don’t have in their upstream agreements. Finally, some kinds of training data, such as medical records or classified government data, may forbid unauthorized access or use in systems that lack adequate safeguards and audit logs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>This question is less relevant to companies that have an entirely in-house workflow (they generate their own training data, train their own models, and use models with their own employees and tools).&nbsp; It is highly relevant to companies that buy or sell ML services, use external vendors for part of their workflow, or handle sensitive data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong>&nbsp; The notion of downstream rights is not a new question, nor is it specific to the ML world.&nbsp; Almost all vendor relationships involve delineating the intellectual property (IP) and tools that each party brings to the project, as well as the ownership of new IP developed during the project. Helping founders to recognize and establish those boundaries early on can save them a lot of trouble later.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> This is a question a company definitely wants to answer before they&#8217;ve provided data or services to a counterparty.&nbsp; These issues can be very difficult to resolve once data has been shared or work has begun.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What if …? Then …?&nbsp; and What next?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> A risk is a potential change that comes with consequences.&nbsp; To properly manage risk—to avoid those consequences—you need to identify those changes in advance (perform a risk assessment) and sort out what to do about them (devise your risk mitigation plans). That&#8217;s where this trio of questions comes in: <em>&#8220;What if?&#8221;</em> is the key to a risk assessment, as it opens the discussion on ways a project may deviate from its intended path.&nbsp; <em>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</em> explores the consequences of that deviation.&nbsp;The <em>&#8220;What next?&#8221;</em> starts the discussion on how to handle them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;<em>What if</em> … our data vendor goes out of business? <em>Then?</em>&nbsp;Our business is hamstrung.&nbsp;<em>What next?</em>&nbsp;We&#8217;d better have a backup data vendor in the wings.&nbsp; Or better yet, keep two vendors running concurrently so that we can switch over with minimal downtime.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;<em>What if</em> … something changes, and the model&#8217;s predictions are wrong most of the time?&nbsp;<em>Then? </em>We&#8217;re in serious trouble, because that model is used to automate purchases.&nbsp;<em>What next?</em> We should implement monitors around the model, so that we can note when it&#8217;s acting out of turn. We should also add a &#8216;big red button&#8217; so that a person can quickly, easily, and completely shut it down if it starts to go haywire.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>&nbsp;Once we&#8217;ve sorted out what the client wants to achieve, I&#8217;ll round out the picture by walking them through some <em>&#8220;What if? Then? What next?&#8221;</em> scenarios where things don&#8217;t work out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> It&#8217;s too easy to pretend the not-intended outcomes don&#8217;t exist if you don&#8217;t bring them up. I want my clients to understand what they&#8217;re getting into, so they can make informed decisions on whether and how to proceed. Going through even a small-scale risk assessment like this can shed light on the possible downside loss that&#8217;s lurking alongside their desired path. All of that risk can weigh heavily on their investment, and possibly even wipe out any intended benefit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> The business world, especially Western business culture, has a strange relationship with positive attitudes. This energy can be infectious and it can help to motivate a team across the finish line. It can also convince people to pretend that the non-intended outcomes are too remote or otherwise not worth consideration.&nbsp;That&#8217;s usually when they find out, the hard way, what can really go wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How to handle this varies based on your role in the company, internal company politics, your ability to bring about change, and your ability to weather a storm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>A random question</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> The most important question is one that isn’t expected. It is one that leads to unexpected answers. We don’t have dialog for dialog sake; we do it to learn something new. Sometimes the thing we learn is that we aren’t aligned.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’ve found that the most unexpected thing is something that we wouldn’t choose based on our current thought process. Randomly choosing a question from a collection appropriate for your domain is really valuable. If you are building something for the web, what kinds of questions could you ask about a web project? This is helpful when the checklists of things to do get too large to try all of them. Pick a few at random.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You can take it a step further and pick questions from outside of your domain. This can simply be a list of provocations that require a high amount of interpretation by you to make sense. This is because randomness doesn’t work without the lens of human intuition.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Randomness without this intuition is just garbage. We do the work to bridge from random questions to some new idea related to our problem. We build the analogies in our mind even when something is seemingly not connected at first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>When you find that you keep asking the same questions. I have decks of cards like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies\">Oblique Strategies</a> for provocations, <a href=\"https://www.trytriggers.com/\">Triggers</a> for domain-specific questions, and others that can provide randomness. Domain-specific random questions can also be very impactful. Eventually, I expect models like GPT-n to provide appropriate random questions to prompts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> Even with all of the questions we ask to get out of bias, we are still biased. We still have assumptions we don’t realize. Randomness doesn’t care about your biases and assumptions. It will ask a question that you think on the surface is stupid, but when you think about it is important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> With teams that are high on certainty they may think of the random question as a toy or distraction. The people I’ve found to be incredibly confident in their world trivialize the need to question bias. They will even try to actively subvert the process sometimes. If you hide the fact that a question was randomly chosen, it can go over better.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>In search of the bigger picture &#8230;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you&#8217;re collecting facts—names, numbers, times—then narrow questions will suffice.&nbsp; But if you&#8217;re looking to understand the bigger picture, if you want to get a meeting out of a rut, if you want people to <em>reflect</em> before they speak, then open-ended questions will serve you well.&nbsp; Doubly so when they come from an unexpected source and at an unexpected time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The questions we&#8217;ve documented here have helped us in our roles as an AI consultant, a product manager, and an attorney.&nbsp;(We also found it interesting that we use a lot of the same questions, which tells us how widely applicable they are.) We hope you&#8217;re able to put our favorite questions to use in your work. Perhaps they will even inspire you to devise and test a few of your own.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One point we hope we&#8217;ve driven home is that your goal in asking good questions isn&#8217;t to make yourself look smarter.&nbsp;Nor is it to get the answers you want to hear.&nbsp;Instead, your goal is to explore a problem space, shed light on new options, and mitigate risk. With that new, deeper understanding, you&#8217;re more prepared to work on the wicked problems that face us in the workplace and in the world at large.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/BiQVryBFH3A\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

In traditional software engineering, precedent has been established for the transition of responsibility from development teams to maintenance, user operations, and site reliability teams. New features in an existing product often follow a similar progression. For traditional software, the domain knowledge and skills required to develop new features differ from those necessary to ensure that the product works as intended. Because product development and product operations are distinct, it’s logical for different teams and processes to be responsible for them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In contrast, many production AI systems rely on feedback loops that require the same technical skills used during initial development. Similarly, in “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product</a>,” Emmanuel Ameisen states: “Indeed, exposing a model to users in production comes with a set of challenges that mirrors the ones that come with debugging a model.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a result, at the stage when product managers for other types of products might shift to developing new features (or to other projects altogether), an AI product manager and the rest of the original development team should remain heavily involved. One reason for this is to tackle the (likely) lengthy backlog of ML/AI model improvements that will be discovered after the product engages with the real world. Another, of course, is to ensure that the product functions as expected and desired over time. We describe the final responsibility of the AI PM as <em>coordinating with the engineering, infrastructure, and site reliability teams to ensure all shipped features can be supported at scale.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article offers our perspective into the practical details of the AI PM’s responsibilities in the latter parts of the AI product cycle, as well as some insight into best practices in execution of those responsibilities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Debugging AI Products</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/bringing-an-ai-product-to-market/\">Bringing an AI Product to Market</a>, we distinguished the debugging phase of product development from pre-deployment evaluation and testing. This distinction assumes a slightly different definition of debugging than is often used in software development. We define debugging as the process of using logging and monitoring tools to detect and resolve the inevitable problems that show up in a production environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Emmanuel Ameisen again offers a useful framework for defining errors in AI/ML applications: “&#8230;three areas in particular are most important to verify: inputs to a pipeline, the confidence of a model and the outputs it produces.” To support verification in these areas, a product manager must first ensure that the AI system is capable of reporting back to the product team about its performance and usefulness over time.&nbsp; This may manifest in several ways, including the collection of explicit user feedback or comments via channels outside of the product team, and the provision of mechanisms to dispute the output of the AI system where applicable. Proper AI product monitoring is essential to this outcome.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>I/O validation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a technical perspective, it is entirely possible for ML systems to function on wildly different data. For example, you can ask an ML model to make an inference on data taken from a distribution very different from what it was trained on—but that, of course, results in unpredictable and often undesired performance. Therefore, deployed AI products should include validation steps to ensure that model inputs and outputs are within generally expected limits, before a model training or inference task is accepted as successful.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ideally, AI PMs would steer development teams to incorporate I/O validation into the initial build of the production system, along with the instrumentation needed to monitor model accuracy and other technical performance metrics. But in practice, it is common for model I/O validation steps to be added later, when scaling an AI product. Therefore, the PM should consider the team that will reconvene whenever it is necessary to build out or modify product features that:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>ensure that inputs are present and complete,</li><li>establish that inputs are from a realistic (expected) distribution of the data,</li><li>and trigger alarms, model retraining, or shutdowns (when necessary).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The composition of these teams will vary between companies and products, but a typical cross-functional team would likely include representatives from Data Science (for product-level experimentation and inference task validation), Applied Science (for model performance and evaluation), ML Engineering (for data and feature engineering, as well as model pipeline support) and Software/Feature Engineering (for integration with the full stack of the AI product—such as UI/UX, cloud services, and dev ops tools). Working together, this post-production development team should embrace continuous delivery principles, and prioritize the integration of any additional necessary instrumentation that was not already implemented during the model development process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, the AI PM must work with production engineering teams to design and implement the alerting and remediation framework. Considerations include where to set thresholds for each persona, alert frequency, and the degree of remediation automation (both what’s possible and desired).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Inference Task Speed and SLOs</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>During testing and evaluation, application performance is important, but not critical to success. In the production environment, when the outputs of an ML model are often a central (yet hidden) component of a greater application, speed and reliability are critically important. It is entirely possible for an AI product’s output to be absolutely correct from the perspective of accuracy and data quality, but too slow to be even remotely useful. Consider the case of autonomous vehicles: if the outputs from even one of the many critical ML models that comprise the vehicle’s AI-powered “vision” are delivered <em>after</em> a crash, who cares if they were correct?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In engineering for production, AI PMs must take into account the speed at which information from ML/AI models must be delivered (to validation tasks, to other systems in the product, and to users). Technologies and techniques—such as engineering specifically for GPU/TPU performance and caching—are important tools in the deployment process, but they are also additional components that can fail, and thus be responsible for the failure of an AI product’s core functionality. An AI PM’s responsibility is to ensure that the development team implements proper checks prior to release, and—in the case of failure—to support the incident response teams, until they are proficient in resolving issues independently.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI product managers must also consider availability: the degree to which the service that an AI product provides is <em>available</em> to other systems and users. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) provide a useful framework for encapsulating this kind of decision. In an <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">incident management blog post</a>, Atlassian defines SLOs as: “the individual promises you’re making to that customer… SLOs are what set customer expectations and tell IT and DevOps teams what goals they need to hit and measure themselves against. SLOs can be useful for both paid and unpaid accounts, as well as internal and external customers.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Service Level Indicators, Objectives, and Agreements (SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs) are well-known, frequently used, and well-documented tools for defining the availability of digital services.&nbsp; For cloud infrastructure some of the most common SLO types are concerned with availability, reliability and scalability. For AI products, these same concepts must be expanded to cover not just infrastructure, but also data and the system’s overall performance at a given task. While useful, these constructs are not beyond criticism. Chief among the challenges are: choosing the correct metrics to begin with, measuring and reporting once metrics are selected, and the lack of incentive for a service provider to update the service’s capabilities (which leads to outdated expectations). Despite these concerns, service level frameworks can be quite useful, and should be in the AI PM’s toolkit when designing the kind of experience that an AI product should provide.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Durability</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You must also take durability into account when building a post-production product plan. Even if well-designed, multi-layer fault detection and model retraining systems are carefully planned and implemented, every AI-powered system must be robust to the ever-changing and naturally stochastic environment that we (humans) all live in. Product managers should assume that any probabilistic component of an AI product will break at some point. A <em>good</em> AI product will be able to self-detect and alert experts upon such a failure; a <em>great </em>AI product will be able to detect the most common problems and adjust itself automatically—without significant interruption of services for users, or high-touch intervention by human experts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many ways to improve AI product durability, including:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/when-are-you-planning-to-retrain-your-machine-learning-model-5349eb0c4706\">Time-based model retraining</a>: retraining all core models periodically, regardless of performance.</li><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/why-machine-learning-models-degrade-in-production-d0f2108e9214\">Continuous retraining</a>: a data-driven approach that employs constant monitoring of the model’s key performance indicators and data quality thresholds.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s worth noting that model durability and retraining can raise legal and policy issues. For example, in many regulated industries, changing any core functionality of an AI system’s decision-making capability (i.e., objective functions, major changes to hyperparameters, etc.) require not only disclosure, but also monitored testing.&nbsp; As such, an AI Product Manager’s responsibility here extends to releasing not only a usable product, but one that can be ethically and legally consumed. It’s also important to remember that no matter what the approach to developing and maintaining a highly durable AI system, the product team must have access to high quality, relevant metrics on both model performance and functionality.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Monitoring</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Proper monitoring (and the software instrumentation necessary to perform it) is essential to the success of an AI product. However, monitoring is a loaded term. The reasons for monitoring AI systems are often conflated, as are the different types of monitoring and alerting provided by off-the-shelf tools. Emmanuel Ameisen once again provides a useful and concise definition of model monitoring as a way to “track the health of a system. For models, this means monitoring their performance and the equity of their predictions.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The simplest case of model monitoring is to compute key performance metrics (related to both model fit and inference accuracy) regularly. These metrics can be combined with human-determined thresholds and automated alerting systems to inform when a model has “drifted” beyond normal operating parameters. While ML monitoring is a relatively new product area, standalone commercial products (including <a href=\"https://www.fiddler.ai/\">Fiddler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.superwise.ai/\">superwise.ai</a>) are available, and monitoring tools are incorporated into all the major machine learning platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Separate from monitoring for model freshness, Ameisen also mentions the need to apply technical domain experience in designing monitoring systems that detect fraud, abuse, and attack from external actors. AI PMs should consult with Trust &amp; Safety and Security teams to combine the best principles and technical solutions with existing AI product functionality. In some specific domains—such as financial services or medicine—no easy technical solutions exist. In this case, it is the responsibility of the AI product team to build tools to detect and mitigate fraud and abuse in the system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we’ve mentioned previously, it’s not enough to simply monitor an AI system&#8217;s performance characteristics. It is even more important to consistently ensure that the AI product’s user-facing and business purposes are being fulfilled. This responsibility is shared by the development team with Design, UX Research, SRE, Legal, PR, and Customer Support teams. The AI PM’s responsibility is again to orchestrate reasonable and easily repeatable mitigations to any problems. It is crucial to design and implement specific alerting capabilities for these functions and teams. If you simply wait for complaints, they will arise far too late in the cycle for your team to react properly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No matter how well you research, design, and test an AI system, once it is released, people are going to complain about it. Some of those complaints will likely have merit, and responsible stewardship of AI products requires that users are given the ability to disagree with the system’s outputs and escalate issues to the product team.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is also entirely possible for this feedback to show you that the system is underserving a particular segment of the population, and that you may need a portfolio of models to serve more of the user base. As an AI PM, you have the responsibility to build a safe product for <em>everyone</em> in the population who might use it. This includes consideration of the complexities that come into play with intersectionality. For example, an AI product might produce great outcomes for wealthy, American, cisgender, heterosexual, White women—and although it might be tempting to assume those outcomes would apply to all women, such an assumption would be incorrect. Returning to previous anti-bias and AI transparency tools such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993\">Model Cards for Model Reporting</a> (Timnit Gebru, et al.) is a great option at this point. It is important not to pass this development task off to researchers or engineers alone; it is an integral part of the AI product cycle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If done right, users will never be aware of all the product monitoring and alerting that is in place, but don’t let that trick you. It’s essential to success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Post-Deployment Frameworks</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One question that an AI PM might ask when pondering these post-production requirements is: “This seems hard; can’t I just buy these capabilities from someone else?” This is a fair question, but—as with all things related to machine learning and artificial intelligence—the answer is far from a binary yes or no.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many tools available to help with this process, from traditional vendors and bleeding edge startups alike. Deciding what investment to make in MLOps tooling is an inherently complex task. However, careful consideration and proactive actions often lead to defendable competitive advantages over time. Uber (the developer of <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/scaling-michelangelo/\">Michelangelo</a>), Airbnb (developer of <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2018/public/schedule/detail/68114.html\">zipline</a>), and Google have all taken advantage of superior tooling and operations skills to build market-leading AI products.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nearly every ML/AI library touts full end-to-end capabilities, from enterprise-ready stacks (such as <a href=\"https://www.h2o.ai/\">H20.ai</a>, <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLFlow</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/\">Kubeflow</a>) to the highly specialized and engineer-friendly (such as <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/\">Seldon.io</a>) and everything in-between (like <a href=\"https://dask.org/\">Dask</a>). Enterprise level-frameworks often provide deep and well-supported integration with many common production systems; smaller companies might find this integration unnecessary or overly cumbersome. Regardless, it’s a safe bet that getting these off-the-shelf tools to work with your AI product in the exact ways you need them to will be costly (if not financially, then at least in time and human labor). That said—from a scale, security and features perspective—such capabilities may be required in many mature AI product environments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, building and scaling a software tool stack from scratch requires a significant sustained investment in both developer time and technology. Facebook, Uber, AirBnB, Google, Netflix, and other behemoths have all spent millions of dollars to build their ML development platforms; they also employ dozens to hundreds of employees, each tasked with building and scaling their internal capabilities. The upside here is that such end-to-end development to deployment frameworks and tools eventually become a competitive advantage, in and of themselves. However, it’s worth noting that in such environments, employing a single AI PM is not feasible. Instead, a cadre of PMs focused on different components of the AI product value chain are needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Building great AI products is a significant, cross-disciplinary, and time-consuming undertaking, even for the most mature and well-resourced companies. However, what ML and AI can accomplish at scale can be well worth the investment.&nbsp; Although a return on investment is never guaranteed, our goal is to provide AI PMs with the tools and techniques needed to build highly engaging and impactful AI products in a wide variety of contexts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this article, we focused on the importance of collaboration between product and engineering teams, to ensure that your product not only functions as intended, but is also robust to both the degradation of its effectiveness and the uncertainties of its operating environment. In the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a product release is just the beginning. Product managers have a unique place in the development ecosystem of ML/AI products, because they cannot simply guide the product to release and then turn it over to IT, SRE, or other post-production teams. AI product managers have a responsibility to oversee not only the design and build of the system’s capabilities, but also to coordinate the team during incidents, until the development team has completed enough knowledge transfer for independent post-production operation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The evolution of AI-enabled product experiences is accelerating at breakneck speed. In parallel, the emerging role of AI product management continues to evolve at a similar pace, to ensure that the tools and products delivered to the market provide true utility and value to both customers and businesses. Our goal in this four-part series on AI product management is to increase community awareness and empower individuals and teams to improve their skill sets in order to effectively steer AI product development toward successful outcomes. The best ML/AI products that exist today were brought to market by teams of PhD ML/AI scientists and developers who worked in tandem with resourceful and skilled product teams.&nbsp; All were essential to their success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the field of AI continues to mature, so will the exciting field of AI product management. We can’t wait to see what you build!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Sources:</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning\">MLOps: Continuous delivery and automation pipelines in machine learning</a> (Google)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2020/08/01/mlops-what-you-need-to-know/#43321e9b1214\">MLOps: What you need to know</a> (Forbes)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">SLA vs. SLO vs. SLI: What’s the difference?</a> (Atlassian) </li><li><a href=\"https://toddmorrill.github.io/blog/2019/10/05/MLOps-tooling\">MLOps Tooling</a> (Todd Morrill)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications</a> (O’Reilly)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/\">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> (O’Reilly)</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We would like to thank the many people who have&nbsp; contributed their expertise to the early drafts of the articles in this series, including: Emmanuel Ameisen, Chris Albon, Chris Butler, Ashton Chevalier, Hilary Mason, Monica Rogati, Danielle Thorp, and Matthew Wise.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/PtjwTz5sgwY\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>The release of GPT-3 has reinvigorated a discussion of creativity and artificial intelligence. That&#8217;s a good discussion to have, primarily because it forces us to think carefully about what we mean when we use words like &#8220;creativity&#8221; and &#8220;art.&#8221; As I&#8217;ve argued in the past, each time we have this discussion, we end up raising the bar. Each time an AI system does something that looks “intelligent” or creative, we end up deciding that’s not what intelligence really is.  And that’s a good thing. AI is likely to teach us more about what intelligence and creativity are not than about what they are.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not terribly interested in whether AI can imitate human creativity. &#8220;Can an AI create a &#8216;new&#8217; poem that reads as if it were written by Keats, or a new piano sonata that sounds like Beethoven&#8221; isn&#8217;t a question that&#8217;s worth asking. Of course it can—if not now, it will be able to in the near future. We really don&#8217;t need a new Beethoven sonata; the 32 he wrote are enough. Nor do we need a new Keats ode, limited though his output was. Or a new Rembrandt. Imitation is ultimately a party trick: clever and amusing, but not really important. Sure, if you want texts for greeting cards or elevator music (or maybe even commercial pop), algorithms may do the trick.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What&#8217;s really important is the transition between different forms of creativity. How do you get something that&#8217;s qualitatively new, and not just imitation? Creativity isn&#8217;t about the artifacts as much as it&#8217;s about the transitions. How do you get from Bach to Haydn? How do you get from Haydn to Beethoven? And, even within the career of a single artist: how do you get from the beginning to the end? How do you get from Beethoven&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5dL-65mKe0\">first piano sonata</a>, which sounds like Haydn, to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg9cE-ceso\">last</a>, which at some points anticipates jazz? Artists aren&#8217;t stagnant. But I have no idea how even to ask whether an AI system can “mature” or “grow” in its output.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Great artists (and yes, I&#8217;m presuming a lot with the word &#8220;great&#8221;) frequently work by defining themselves against what came before. This is particularly clear with artists of the Romantic period in Germany, England, and France. The term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism\">Romanticism</a> didn&#8217;t come around until some years later, but they left behind several manifestos describing what they were trying to do, and how it was different from what came before. That is still how artists work: Nnedi Okorafor&#8217;s <a href=\"http://nnedi.blogspot.com/2019/10/africanfuturism-defined.html\">Africanfuturism</a> is important as a way of defining and directing her own work. The importance of these defining statements isn&#8217;t so much about “rightness” (in the sense of &#8220;this is what art is or should be&#8221;) but in setting a direction for their project. Can a machine do that? Can it decide how its work will be different from what came before? It&#8217;s not clear to me that it can&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s a significant step beyond any machine learning projects we currently have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although artists work by projecting their work into the future, by defining something &#8220;new,&#8221; their work is also derived from what came before—possibly as misinterpretation, but almost always as revision. Listen to the Beatles, and you hear something that was really built on the backbone of blues, filtered through some British pop-cultural trends. At the end of the &#8220;His Dark Materials&#8221; trilogy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pullman\">Phillip Pullman</a> thanks all the authors he stole from. Or, as T. S. Eliot <a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/200/sw11.html\">said</a>, “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.” Artists break from the past by reinterpreting that past.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For AI-generated art&#8211;where does that sense of &#8220;different&#8221; come from? Can artificial intelligence learn to steal and reinterpret? Where does that engagement with history, current events and even selfhood come from?  Without that, there’s no basis for reinterpretation aside from random perturbation. It&#8217;s not clear that a sense of history couldn&#8217;t come from a big model trained on a gigantic corpus (although the best we can do now is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/\">build models that have no idea what they are saying</a>). What kind of model would take that corpus and make something that was different, something that hadn&#8217;t been seen before? Would we care if Hamlet wasn&#8217;t written by Shakespeare in a specific historical context, but in 2025 by a computer trained on an archive of Elizabethan politics, drama, and history? (Never mind that an archive of Elizabethan drama would be very skimpy; most plays from that period were never published.) Would anyone care about the opera <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_in_China\">Nixon in China</a> if it didn&#8217;t reflect a composer&#8217;s, and a librettist&#8217;s, thinking about historical events?\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s another way in which I find computed-generated artworks unsatisfactory, particularly in music. AI-generated music is often interesting over the short term, but fails at larger-scale structure. Much of music history, from four-bar blues to Beethoven&#8217;s massive experiments in sonata form, is about building structures that can be interesting over the long term, whether &#8220;long term&#8221; means a few minutes of a blues song to several hours of opera. That was Beethoven&#8217;s project; more recently, it was the project of rock groups like Pink Floyd. It seems conceivable that a model could learn to generate such longer-form structures, but I&#8217;ve yet to see one that does it satisfactorily.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is this where collaboration between humans and machines comes in, and if so, what does that say about creativity? A machine could conceivably do the pattern-matching and combinatorics, assembling a creative work out of news clippings and stylistic mimicry. But a human still needs to supply the sense of history that makes the work something we care about. A human still needs to provide the structure that makes art works more than brief curiosities. Is it possible for a human could tweak a model like GPT-3 to give it that sense of direction and context? What kinds of user interfaces would facilitate this kind of interaction?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I can&#8217;t answer those questions, but that sounds like a much more interesting form of digital collaboration than having an algorithm write hundreds of dull poems or songs and “curating” a few that aren’t boring. That&#8217;s just a recipe for greeting-card sentiment and elevator music. I mean no disrespect to Hallmark—mass-produced poetry for greeting cards serves a purpose—but when we think about what kinds of creativity we want, and how that creativity will be mediated by AI, we should demand more.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/YrWZYgHiWmQ\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

I suspect that the legal system will be a big driver for technology over the next year. Another trend that doesn’t quite count as technology news but that definitely bears watching is that <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/09/24/undergraduate-enrollment-falls-25-percent-community-college-enrollment-75-percent\">college enrollment in the US is down</a>. Grad schools are up, 4 year colleges are down slightly; the big hit is in 2 year colleges. COVID is probably the biggest contributing factor, but regardless of the cause, this is an inauspicious trend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>AI and Data</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Beyond Text: Some experiments have trained GPT-3 on both text and images, enabling it to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/25/1008921/ai-allen-institute-generates-images-from-captions/\">generate images from captions</a>.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-09-algorithm-problem-cars-human-brain.html\">The importance of time series</a>: I’m less impressed with using time series to estimate the cost of an auto repair than with the possible applications of time series. Time series has had less attention than NLP, but it’s equally important.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03945\">Can BERT learn common sense</a>? Possibly. 50% correct answers to “common sense” problems doesn’t sound impressive, but I wonder how well humans would score.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-09-brain-memory-abilities-ai-experts.html\">Training AI not to forget</a> using generative replay techniques: One problem with neural networks is that they frequently “forget” important features in the data. Replay is an idea that is based on&nbsp;how humans remember: we can strengthen memories by recalling significant events.<br /></li><li>Microsoft <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed\">Deep Speed</a> uses new parallelism techniques to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/10/microsofts-updated-deepspeed-can-train-trillion-parameter-ai-models-with-fewer-gpus/\">train very large models</a> (billions of parameters) with less CPU and GPU power.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/09/22/microsoft-teams-up-with-openai-to-exclusively-license-gpt-3-language-model/\">Microsoft gets an exclusive license to OpenAI’s GPT-3</a>: The public-facing API will remain, but access to the code is limited to Microsoft. As MIT Tech Review <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/23/1008729/openai-is-giving-microsoft-exclusive-access-to-its-gpt-3-language-model/\">points out</a>, this is a significant departure from OpenAI’s vision of freedom from both government and for-profit money.<br /></li><li>Biological signatures (e.g., heartbeat) can be used to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/09/03/ai-researchers-use-heartbeat-detection-to-identify-deepfake-videos/\">detect deep fakes</a>. It’s not news that your pulse can be detected in video. But the process of creating a fake distorts these signatures in ways that are detectable.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.diffbot.com/\">Diffbot</a> is building a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/04/1008156/knowledge-graph-ai-reads-web-machine-learning-natural-language-processing/\">knowledge graph of the entire web</a>. It’s not a language model (though they may add a natural language query feature); it’s a database of facts in subject-verb-object form. Diffbot represents an older approach to machine learning that, in practice, might work better than language models like GPT-3.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-09-machine-everyday-actions.html\">Visual reasoning</a> with machine learning enables AI systems to reason about what people are doing and how they are doing it. This is an important step towards building robots that can function properly as assistants to humans.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Law</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Trump’s attempt to block <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/trump-asks-u-s-court-to-allow-wechat-ban-to-proceed\">WeChat</a> has been blocked by the courts; now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tiktok-ban-judge/judge-temporarily-blocks-u-s-ban-on-tiktok-downloads-from-u-s-app-stores-idUSKBN26J00R\">TikTok</a> is in the same state. (The decision allows users to download TikTok; other restrictions that come into effect in November are still in place.) These blocks are only temporary, so presumably the future of these companies in the US is in the hands of the legal system.<br /></li><li>I have seen reports that the EU is interested in the TikTok deal for some unsurprising reasons. The EU is also concerned about social media companies headquartered in another superpower amassing their citizens&#8217; data. Unintended\\xa0consequences?<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/09/21/the-push-for-content-moderation-legislation-around-the-world/\">Content moderation legislation</a>: Brookings reports that legislation is increasingly focused on protecting aggrieved citizens than protecting innovation, and that legislation about content moderation is under consideration in Europe, Brazil, the US, and many other countries.<br /></li><li>There has been a lot of regulation surrounding privacy, but privacy regulation doesn’t address the problems raised by <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/04/1008164/ai-biometric-face-recognition-regulation-amba-kak/\">biometrics</a> (including face recognition). A key issue is what happens when data is used outside of its original context: for example, when drivers license photos are used by agencies like ICE. AINow has published a <a href=\"https://ainowinstitute.org/regulatingbiometrics.pdf\">report</a> on the need for biometric regulation. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Virtual and Augmented Reality</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>VR/AR glasses again: Facebook projects releasing the “next step on the road to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/facebook-ar-glasses-2021/\">augmented reality glasses</a>” next year. It apparently won’t have a projector. One suspects it will have a camera, privacy concerns notwithstanding.<br /></li><li>The virtual trading floor: <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/09/traders-set-to-don-virtual-reality-headsets-in-their-home-offices/\">Investment companies are starting to use VR</a> so traders can experience the trading floor while working from home. (Is this really a good idea?)<br /></li><li>Augmented reality for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/augmented-reality-could-be-the-geology-classrooms-killer-app/\">virtual geology</a> probably isn’t a killer app, but it’s a useful tool for a science that can often involve a lot of travel. The authors say that AR leads to a better learning experience than VR because the students can actually see the teacher, rather than an avatar. Developing for <a href=\"https://blog.lookingglassfactory.com/learn/creating-holographic-user-interfaces/\">holographic user interfaces</a> may be the next step after Virtual Reality.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Cloud</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>“Serverless 2.0” from Lightbend: <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/cloudstate-is-lightbends-attempt-to-define-serverless-2-0/\">Cloudstate</a> implements function-as-a-service with stateful functions. It remains to be seen how well this will catch on, but until now, FaaS has required functions to be stateless.<br /></li><li>Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/05/24/a-closer-look-at-azure-arc--microsofts-hybrid-and-multi-cloud-platform/#27ed3bf921bc\">Azure Arc</a> lets you integrate on-premises servers or Kubernetes clusters with an Azure cloud. There’s been a lot of talk about hybrid cloud, but this strikes me as the most seamless integration possible.<br /></li><li>Google adds <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/google-launches-confidential-vms-gke-nodes-to-encrypt-data-in-use/\">Confidential VMs and Confidential Kubernetes Engines</a> to its cloud. These encrypt data as it’s in use (in memory), as distinct from encrypting data and storage (on disk) or in flight (on a network).<br /></li><li>Microsoft is experimenting with <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/in-search-for-future-of-cloud-storage-researchers-look-to-holographic-storage-solutions/\">holographic storage</a> for the cloud: extremely high volume, long-term storage.<br /></li><li><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/webassembly-could-be-the-key-for-cloud-native-extensibility/\">WebAssembly and Cloud Native</a>: Could Wasm become the language for extending service meshes, allowing developers to write in any language they choose?&nbsp; Google has been pushing this idea for Envoy and Istio.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Quantum Computing</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>IBM’s Quantum Roadmap projects a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/ibm-publishes-its-quantum-roadmap-says-it-will-have-a-1000-qubit-machine-in-2023/\">1000-Qubit machine</a> by 2023. These are “physical” qubits, and may only be the equivalent of 50 or so logical qubits.&nbsp; (The difference is due to error correction.) Google has published a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanmlarose/status/1305914786451009537\">similar roadmap</a>, with practical quantum computers (1 million physical qubits) by 2029.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Security</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>The Grugq’s definition of <a href=\"https://gru.gq/2020/09/14/cybercraft-the-short-version/\">Cybercraft</a> as a parallel to (and tool of) statecraft needs to inform thinking about security and operations. This is a consequence of a return to geopolitical competition that isn’t limited to the “great powers.”</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Programming</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-arm-for-40-billion-creating-worlds-premier-computing-company-for-the-age-of-ai\">NVIDIA is acquiring ARM</a> for $40B. This acquisition establishes NVIDIA as a powerhouse in general purpose computing, and as serious competition for Intel and AMD in their core businesses. Their intent is clearly to be a one-stop provider for AI and other applications that require high performance arithmetic.<br /></li><li>“<a href=\"https://qz.com/778380/the-future-is-software-engineers-who-cant-code/\">Everyone will be a software engineer, and barely any will know how to code</a>.”&nbsp; A quirky but prescient article arguing that the key skill is understanding how to solve problems with software, not produce it. Certainly if no code and low code products democratize software creation, we’ll be left with the problem of understanding what the software should do.<br /></li><li>A video transcoder in the browser using <a href=\"https://modfy.video/\">Wasm</a> is the most compelling demo of Wasm that I’ve seen yet. Wasm isn’t “coming”; it’s clearly already here. Developers just aren’t using it yet.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Cryptocurrency</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Many countries (the US is notably absent) are building pandemic-relief programs around <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/09/1008226/smart-stimulus-cash-as-code/\">central bank digital currency</a> (cryptocurrency). This is a stepping stone to broader use of digital currency.</li></ul>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/lwAz4OyvLuQ\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",
